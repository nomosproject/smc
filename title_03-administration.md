## Subtitle I - Administrative Code
### Chapter 3.02 - ADMINISTRATIVE CODE

Sections:

#### 3.02.010 - Short title.

This chapter shall constitute and may be referred to as the "Administrative Code" of The City of Seattle.


#### 3.02.020 - Definitions.

Such term does not include statements concerning only the internal management of an agency and not affecting private rights or procedures available to the public, declaratory rulings issued pursuant to Section 3.02.080, or rules relating to the use of public ways and property when substance of such rules is indicated to the public by means of signs or signals.


1. "Agency" means The City of Seattle or any of its subdivisions including but not limited to, any City board, commission, committee, officer or department, including the City Council and its committees, when acting in accordance with or pursuant to authorization by ordinance or Charter to make rules, hear appeals, or adjudicate contested cases.
2. "Contested case" means any proceeding before an agency in which the legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are required by ordinance to be determined after a hearing by a Hearing Examiner.
3. "Interested person" means any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization of any character significantly affected by or interested in proceedings before an agency, and shall include any party in a contested case.
4. "License" includes the whole or part of any agency permit, certificate, approval, registration, or any form of permission required by law, including agency rules, to engage in any activity, but does not include a license required solely for revenue purposes.
5. "Rule" means any agency order, directive, or regulation of future effect, including amendment or repeal of a prior rule, which applies generally and which, if violated, subjects a person to a penalty or administrative sanction, including, but not limited to, an order, directive, or regulation which affects:

    1. Any procedure, practice or requirement relating to agency hearings;
    2. Any qualification or standards for the issuance, suspension or revocation of licenses;
    3. Any mandatory standards for any product or material which must be met before distribution or sale; or
    4. Any qualification or requirement relating to the enjoyment of benefits or privileges conferred by law.

#### 3.02.030 - Notice and hearing on adoption of rules.

Prior to the adoption, amendment or repeal of any rule, an agency shall:


1. Within the time specified by the ordinance authorizing such action, or if no time is specified, at least fourteen (14) days prior to the proposed action and at least ten (10) days prior to a public hearing, if any, give notice thereof by: (1) publication in a newspaper in accordance with the City Charter and, where appropriate, in such trade, industry, or professional publication, as the agency may select; and (2) by mailing or delivery to the address specified by any person who has made written request therefor, which shall be filed with the agency and renewed annually. Such notice shall include: (a) a reference to the authority under which such rule is proposed; (b) an accurate description of the substance of the proposed rule or of the subjects and issues involved; and (c) a statement of the time and place of any public hearing, and manner in which interested persons may present data, views or argument thereon to the agency;
2. Afford all interested persons an opportunity to present data, views, or arguments in regard to the proposed action; provided, that if the agency finds that oral presentation is unnecessary or impracticable, it may require that presentation be made in writing;
3. Give appropriate consideration to economic values, along with any environmental, social, health, and safety factors, affected by the proposed adoption, amendment or repeal of any rule.

#### 3.02.040 - Petition for rules.

Any interested person may petition an agency requesting the adoption, amendment or repeal of any rule. Each agency shall prescribe by rule the procedure for submission, consideration and disposition of such petitions. Within sixty (60) days after the submission of a petition, the agency shall either deny such petition in writing (stating its reasons for the denial), or initiate rulemaking proceedings concerning the subject of such petition in accordance with Section 3.02.030.


#### 3.02.050 - Emergency action.

Where the agency finds that immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, such action may be taken and become effective upon filing such adoption, amendment or repeal with the City Clerk. This shall be accompanied by a statement of the facts upon which the findings of an emergency and necessity are based. The adoption, amendment or repeal of a rule under this section shall be for a period of sixty (60) days unless the notice and hearing procedures set forth in Section 3.02.030 have been complied with within this time period, or unless there has been a more limiting statement placed within the rule itself. This emergency section does not relieve any agency from compliance with any law requiring that the adoption, amendment or repeal be approved by designated persons or bodies before they become effective, nor shall any action be taken under this section which affects any pending case or controversy.


#### 3.02.060 - Rules to be filed.

Each agency shall file with the City Clerk two (2) certified copies of all agency rules, which rules shall become effective on the date of filing. The City Clerk shall keep, index and compile copies of all such rules filed with him or her, and shall make such rules available for inspection by the public during regular business hours and furnish copies thereof to any person requesting the same and paying such fee as shall be prescribed by ordinance.


#### 3.02.070 - Public information.

1. In addition to other rulemaking requirements imposed by ordinance, each agency shall:

    1. Adopt as a rule a description of its organization, stating the general course and method of its operations, location of its offices, and the methods whereby the public may obtain information, make submittals or requests, or obtain copies of agency decisions;
    2. File with the City Clerk all procedures adopted pursuant to Ordinance 101810, as amended, Chapter 3.96.
2. Each agency shall make available for public inspection all final opinions and orders, and all rules and written statements of policy or interpretation formulated, adopted, or used by the agency in the discharge of its functions, and shall further make available for public inspection and copying all indexes maintained for agency use.
3. Except to the extent that a person has actual knowledge thereof, no agency rule, order, or opinion shall be effective against any person, nor shall it be invoked by the City for any purpose until made available for public inspection as required in this section and Section 3.02.060.
4. Nothing in this section shall affect the confidentiality of records as provided by law.

#### 3.02.080 - Declaratory ruling.

On petition of any interested person, any agency may issue a declaratory ruling with respect to applicability to any person, property, or state of facts of any rules or ordinance enforceable by it. Such petition shall be considered, and granted or denied in accordance with Section 3.02.040. A declaratory ruling, if issued after argument and stated to be binding, is binding between the agency and the petitioner on the state of facts alleged, unless it is altered or set aside by a court upon judicial review in the manner prescribed by law.


#### 3.02.090 - Hearings in contested cases

1. In any contested case all parties shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing after not less than 20 days' notice in writing; provided that a hearing may be set on shorter notice where substantial injury to a party would otherwise result; provided further, that unless otherwise provided by ordinance or rule, no hearing shall be required in any case except upon the request of a party. A request for a hearing shall be accompanied by a filing fee as established by ordinance, which the Hearing Examiner shall ensure is received by the Director of Finance and Administrative Services.

3. Unless otherwise provided by ordinance, notice shall be provided by personal service or mail to each party. Notice to City agencies may be provided through the City's interoffice mail or electronically.

12. Examiners may take notice of judicially cognizable facts and of general, technical, or scientific facts within their specialized knowledge in the evaluation of the evidence presented to them; provided, that parties shall be notified during the hearing, or by reference in preliminary reports or otherwise, of the material so noticed, and they shall be afforded an opportunity to contest the facts so noticed.
13. Every party shall have the right of cross-examination of witnesses who testify, and shall have the right to submit rebuttal evidence.

#### 3.02.100 - Report and review of examiner's recommendation or decision in contested cases

In connection with the consideration by the agency of any proposed decision, any party may file written exceptions to the proposed decision or part thereof and may submit a proposed substitute decision and supporting argument. Following consideration of the proposed decision and any proposed substitute decision, written exceptions, or arguments, the agency may adopt, reject, or modify the proposed decision or any part thereof, and shall issue its decision with its written findings and reasons for any changes from the Hearing Examiner's proposed decision.


1. Within the period fixed by agency rule or applicable ordinance, the Hearing Examiner shall prepare a written recommendation or decision, file it as a public record and provide copies of it by personal service or mail to each party and to other interested persons as provided by agency rule or applicable ordinance.

If the decision is to be made by the agency, the Hearing Examiner's recommendation shall be in the form of a proposed decision which may be adopted by the agency as its decision in the case.
2. Where a decision is to be made by an agency based upon the Hearing Examiner's recommendation, the agency shall set a date for consideration of the Hearing Examiner's proposed decision, and shall give at least 10 days notice of the date to all parties; provided, that at the discretion of the Hearing Examiner, and upon a written showing of adequate reason for the delay, evidence not previously presented may be submitted to the Hearing Examiner prior to the date set for the agency's consideration of the proposed decision. If the Hearing Examiner determines to accept and consider such evidence, the Hearing Examiner shall immediately give notice to each party of record and to the agency, which shall remand the proposed decision to the Hearing Examiner for further consideration and hearing in accordance with Section 3.02.090, and for such modification of the proposed decision as the Hearing Examiner may make pursuant to the hearing.

    2. Upon the request of an agency or any party, or upon his own volition, issue and cause to be served subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and for production for examination of any books, records, or other information in the possession and under the control of any witness; provided that any such subpoena shall state the name and address of the witness sought, and if for the production of books, documents or things, shall specifically identify the same and the relevance thereof to the issues involved;

3. Using resources provided in the annual budget for the normal operation of the Office of Hearing Examiner, the Hearing Examiner may provide hearing examiner services to other public entities not likely to appear before the Hearing Examiner in City of Seattle matters. The Hearing Examiner is authorized, on behalf of the City and without further ordinance, to enter into one (1) or more contracts with other public entities, whether pursuant to RCW 39.34.080 or otherwise, under which the Hearing Examiner will provide, and the City of Seattle will be compensated for, those services. Before entering into any contract under this subsection, the Hearing Examiner shall obtain the advice of the City Attorney and the Risk Manager as to the contract's provisions for liability and indemnification. The compensation called for in each contract shall be established by the Hearing Examiner as he or she deems appropriate in each instance, but shall always be designed, at a minimum, to recover the Hearing Examiner's marginal costs of performing the services. The Hearing Examiner is authorized to accept all monetary compensation received under these contracts for deposit in the General Subfund.

##### 3.14.450 - Establishment, Duration, Modification and Termination

In accordance with the provisions of this section 3.14.450, the City Council may by resolution recognize a sister city association, change the status of a sister city association from active to emeritus, or terminate the relationship with the sister city association.
2. In order to ensure that sister city affiliations genuinely engage Seattle's values, represent Seattle's current international landscape, and can be managed by resident associations with resources adequate to the task, proposals to the City for establishing sister city affiliations shall be initiated by sister city associations in the following two-step process:

    1. Step One.

        1. The City of Seattle will consider a new sister city affiliation if the following steps are completed:

            1. Submission of a letter of intent;
            2. Submission of documentation indicating why a prospective sister city is proposed and verifying that it is the center of significant educational, civic, cultural, and/or political resources that offer Seattle's residents and/or City agencies significant two-way exchange opportunities, which will serve to enrich the understanding of both parties;
            3. Submission of documentation indicating that a prospective sister city has the prospect of being a significant business partner, or has some other major economic aspect that is similar to or complementary to the economic character of Seattle;
            4. Confirmation that a prospective sister city does not have a sister city affiliation with another city in the United States, or confirmation that any U.S. city having prior affiliation with the foreign prospective city does not object to Seattle establishing a new affiliation with the prospective sister city;
            5. Confirmation that there should be no existing sister city relationship between the City of Seattle and any other city of the same foreign country;
            6. Submission of a description of the sponsoring group and/or sponsoring individuals;
        2. The above documentation must be submitted to the Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council for its review and consideration. The Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council may reject or accept the application by a majority vote of the full Council, and so advise the Mayor, the City Council, and the applicant(s);

            1. No further action will be taken on an application once it is rejected, unless otherwise directed by a majority of City Council members or by the Mayor;
            2. If the application is accepted, the prospective sister city applicant then must meet the criteria listed in Step 2, subsection 3.14.050.B.2, below.
        3. The City of Seattle will recognize only one sister city association per sister city affiliation.
    2. Step Two. In order to be recognized by the City of Seattle, a sister city association must verify that it has the following:

        1. At least 30 paid members, reflecting a diverse representation of the Seattle community, committed to meet the objectives of the sister city program, as outlined in section 3.14.440;
        2. A formal incorporated structure in accordance with Washington State Law governing nonprofit corporations (see RCW 24.03) and 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization status with the Internal Revenue Service;
        3. Established bylaws outlining annual election of officers and board members, and any appropriate functional subcommittees;
        4. A comprehensive work plan for the twelve-month period following the request for formal affiliation, showing how the activities of this association will further the objectives of the Seattle sister city program;
        5. A budget for the first year's activities, showing any funds available to meet the budget requirements and indicating how the association plans to fund its activities in the future; and,
        6. A preliminary indication from the government of the foreign city that a sister city relationship with the City of Seattle would be welcome.
    3. Upon a favorable review by the Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council, the association's application will be sent to the Mayor and City Council with a recommendation for a final vote.
3. Duration of Sister City Affiliations. Each sister city affiliation will enjoy a five-year term of active status, subject to the following provisions:

    1. Review. Beginning six months prior to the end of an affiliation's five-year term, the Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council will make a formal recommendation to City Council on the question of whether or not to renew the sister city affiliation for an additional five-year term. Renewal will be the default recommendation for each affiliation, unless the Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council or City Council, using the following independent indicators, determines that the affiliation should not be renewed:

        1. The relationship with the affiliated city continues to embody qualities and/or values central to Seattle's core interests and international landscape;
        2. The respective sister city association has maintained active status, as defined by the provisions of subsection 3.14.450.D below;
        3. The respective sister city association has avoided any punitive action(s) taken by the Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council for faults in ethical behavior of its members;
        4. The respective sister city association is not currently under emeritus status and is not currently under Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council review for reactivation.
    2. Timing of five-year terms - existing associations. Associations that hold active status at the effective date of this ordinance will be subject to review in staggered groups of five associations each year. The initial reviews for the first group of five associations will begin within three years of the effective date of this ordinance. The next group will be reviewed within four years, and so on. Following the initial review, each group of associations will be subject to the five-year reviews described in this subsection 3.14.450.C.1. The groupings for these staggered five-year reviews will be determined by the Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council.
    3. Timing of five-year terms - new associations. The initial review for associations that do not hold active status on the effective date of this ordinance, and that are later established, will occur at the five-year anniversary of the date the resolution granting the association active status. Following the initial review, each association under this paragraph will be subject to the five-year reviews as described in this subsection 3.14.450.C.1.
4. Minimum Criteria for Maintaining Active Status. All of the following minimum criteria are necessary for an association to maintain active status:

    1. At least (30) paid members;
    2. A comprehensive work plan for the calendar year showing how the activities of this association will further the objectives of the sister city program, made available to the Office of Intergovernmental Relations by February 1st of each year;
    3. A calendar year budget for the association's activities indicating how the association plans to fund its activities and how it plans to spend the small sum of City funds available for eligible reimbursable expenses, made available to the Office of Intergovernmental Relations by February 1st of each year;
    4. An annual report of the association's activities including explanations for how each activity furthered the objectives of the sister city program, made available to the Office of Intergovernmental Relations at the same time the association submits its formal request for annual reimbursement of eligible expenses;
    5. Indication from the appropriate government officials or other organizations officially delegated by the foreign city that the sister city relationship remains official and active;
    6. Nonprofit status (see RCW 24.03). Each sister city association must register with the State of Washington's Office of the Secretary of State as a nonprofit organization authorized to solicit gifts or contributions. Each association must renew such registration annually and maintain non-profit status with the United States Internal Revenue Service;
    7. Annual meeting. Each association must hold an annual meeting that includes election of officers and a board of directors. Such meetings must be open to the public, and a written announcement or invitation must be sent at least two weeks in advance to all members of the association and the Office of Intergovernmental Relations. Results of regular board elections must be reported in writing to the Office of Intergovernmental Relations;
    8. Assistance facilitating visits to the City of Seattle by sister city dignitaries. It is the paramount duty of each association to help facilitate visits to the City of Seattle by government officials from their respective sister cities. Such assistance often will include: developing and supporting itineraries for the dignitaries of any meetings with the City of Seattle, addressing transportation needs for the dignitaries; offering advice on accommodations in Seattle; and, where appropriate, helping facilitate mutual exchange of diplomatic gifts for the dignitaries;
    9. Program activity. Each association must sponsor at least two program activities annually (in addition to the annual meeting). Such activities might include a forum on best practices between City of Seattle experts and their counterparts in the foreign sister city; an event focused on education or culture; a public local exhibit or performance, an exchange program or delegation with the counterpart city abroad. These programs must be open to the public, and written announcements or invitations must be sent to all members of the association, the City Councilmember acting as liaison and the Office of Intergovernmental Relations;
    10. Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council and Seattle Sister Cities Presidents' Committee meetings. Regular attendance by a representative who is a member of the Council and/or Committee will be considered in determining an association's status.
5. Review and Determination of Active Status. Separate from subsection 3.14.450.C above (i.e., "Duration of Sister City Affiliations"), and given the importance of maintaining open, active and rewarding relationships with Seattle's sister cities, the Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council is tasked with monitoring the vibrancy and productivity of each Seattle Sister City Association. Should a sister city association or sister city affiliation cease to effectively function during its five-year term, the Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council will make recommendations about the course of action that Seattle should take with that sister city partner. Active status will serve as the default status for each association. The Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council may recommend withdrawal of an association's active status. The following review process will be used by the Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council when making these determinations:

    1. If an association fails to meet the criteria for active status in a specific calendar year, the Office of Intergovernmental Relations shall notify that association, and also will inform the Mayor's Office, the City Council President, and the City Councilmember who is assigned to that association as the City Council's liaison;
    2. The Office of Intergovernmental Relations shall notify and request a meeting with the association to discuss the association's non-compliance;
    3. The Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council or designated representative shall review the situation and shall meet with the president or other officer(s) of the association to review the criteria for retaining active status;
    4. The association shall be asked to submit a written plan for meeting the minimum criteria in the next calendar year;
    5. After completing the process outlined above and reviewing any submissions by the association, the Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council may recommend to the Mayor and City Council that a Sister City association be allowed six months to revitalize its efforts, subject to all of the criteria for an active sister city association, or that the sister city relationship be granted "emeritus status," the process for which is governed by section F below.
6. Determination of Emeritus Status. Emeritus status is intended to simultaneously honor the historical relationship between the two cities and signify that the sister city relationship is no longer active. Emeritus status further signifies that an association no longer has access to revenues for annual reimbursement of eligible expenses.

    1. Prior to recommending emeritus status for any sister city association, the Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council should fulfill the following steps:

        1. Document that the local sister city association has been inactive for one year or, alternatively, conclude that the association cannot meet the requisite criteria for maintaining active status;
        2. Attempt to make contact with last known board members of the sister city association and inquire about the association's posture;
        3. Determine if the foreign city is actively engaged in additional sister city relationships with U.S. cities other than Seattle.
    2. Upon receiving this recommendation from the Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council, the Office of Intergovernmental Relations shall conduct a review of the formal relationship between the two cities, and submit its recommendation to the Mayor and City Council regarding an appropriate course of action.
    3. If a sister city association status is changed from active to emeritus status or the relationship is terminated, the city abroad will be notified.
7. Regaining Active Status after Emeritus Status or Termination. A sister city affiliation that has been granted emeritus status or had its relationship with the City terminated, may seek reactivation only when City Council is formally considering adding one or more new sister city affiliations. In such a case, the association will be equally subject to any process required for new sister city associations. Associations with emeritus status will not enjoy special consideration during this review process.
8. Termination. The City may, after City Council passes a supporting resolution, terminate a contract with a sister city association without cause, with 30 days written notice. All contracts with sister city associations shall contain a termination clause stating this same provision. If the sister city abroad formally terminates its sister city relationship with the City of Seattle, the sister city association's relationship with the City shall also be deemed terminated.

##### 3.14.460 - Coordinating Council—Appointments, Membership and Terms.

1. The Seattle Sister Cities Coordinating Council shall consist of 20 members. Seven members shall be comprised of the following: one representative from each of five sister city associations, rotating membership according to alphabetical order of the name of the sister city, every two years in order to represent all associations; one representative from the City Council, chosen by the City Council President; one representative from the Office of Intergovernmental Relations (OIR), chosen by the OIR Director.

##### 3.28.110 - Firearms—Purpose of provisions.

The purpose of Sections 3.28.110 through 3.28.125 is to regulate the discharge of firearms by Seattle police officers during the performance of their duty to protect life, property and the public safety and to provide effective law enforcement. Sections 3.28.110 through 3.28.125 are not intended, nor may they be construed or applied, to create a duty toward any person who may be injured by the use of a firearm by a Seattle police officer, or to provide a basis for tort liability against the City, its officials, or its individual police officers.


##### 3.28.115 - Firearms—Discharge authorized when.

While engaged in the performance of duties of a Seattle police officer, an officer may discharge a firearm at another person when necessary to:


1. Defend himself or another person from death or serious bodily injury;
2. Apprehend, arrest or prevent the escape of a person, whom the officer reasonably believes from the evidence available, has committed murder, manslaughter, mayhem, felonious assault, robbery, burglary, kidnapping, arson, rape or a felony involving a bomb;
3. Apprehend an escaped or rescued felon, who has been arrested for, convicted of, or committed for a felony.

A police officer may not use a firearm unless all other reasonable alternatives have been exhausted or would appear to a reasonable police officer to be ineffective under the particular circumstances.


##### 3.28.120 - Firearms—Chief may establish rules.

The Chief of Police may promulgate rules and regulations to implement Sections 3.28.110 through 3.28.125; provided, that such rules and regulations shall be consistent with the purpose and provisions of Sections 3.28.110 through 3.28.125.


##### 3.28.125 - Firearms—Penalty for violation.

Any police officer who discharges a firearm at another person in violation of Sections 3.28.110 through 3.28.125 shall be subject to disciplinary proceedings and punishment authorized by The City of Seattle Charter, Article XVI, including but not limited to reprimand, suspension without pay, demotion and discharge.

Every Seattle Police Department peace officer shall, when wearing a Seattle Police Department uniform, also wear a Seattle Police Department authorized and issued name tag or similar identification device bearing that officer's first initial and last name in legible block print of at least twenty-four (24) point typeface. This requirement shall apply whether or not such officer is on duty.
2. No Seattle Police Department peace officer required to wear a name tag or similar identification device pursuant to subsection A of this section shall alter or obscure such name tag or device.
3. All name tags or similar identification devices required pursuant to subsection A of this section shall be worn on the outermost layer of the Seattle Police Department peace officer's uniform, in the upper-front torso area. The outermost layer of such officer's uniform must also identify the name of the officer's law-enforcement agency.
4. In situations where it is reasonably foreseeable that a Seattle Police Department peace officer required to wear a name tag or similar identification device pursuant to subsection A of this section may remove the outermost layer of the officer's uniform, then that officer also shall wear such a name tag or device in the required location on any underlying layer of his or her uniform that may become the outermost layer.
5. When required to wear a name tag or similar identification device pursuant to subsection A of this section and, upon request for identification by a member of the public, a Seattle Police Department peace officer shall clearly and audibly state his or her name to the requesting person. The requirements of this subsection E shall not apply when the officer reasonably believes that such identification would endanger the life or physical safety of the officer or another person, jeopardize a law-enforcement investigation, or hinder a law-enforcement function.
6. For purposes of this section, "uniform" is defined to include, in addition to its normal meaning, any law-enforcement agency issued or approved coat, jacket, sweater, jumpsuit, or protective suit that may be worn as an outer layer of clothing or in conjunction with a uniform, but shall not include civilian attire worn by plain-clothes or undercover officers.
7. For purposes of this section, "peace officer" includes a general authority Washington peace officer as defined in RCW 10.93.020, or a specially-commissioned Washington peace officer as defined in RCW 10.93.020.
8. This section shall not be construed to prohibit the Seattle Police Department from implementing or enforcing any policy, procedure or rule that is not inconsistent herewith.
9. Nothing in this section or elsewhere in CB 113332 shall be construed to affect the authority of any peace officer to enforce the traffic, criminal or other laws in The City of Seattle, pursuant to RCW Chapter 10.93 or otherwise, or to affect the lawfulness of an otherwise lawful act by any such peace officer.


#### Subchapter II - Special Police
##### 3.28.150 - Commission—Issuance conditions.

Upon termination of his commission, a Special Police Officer shall return to the Police Department his identification card, notice of commission, badge, and any other equipment issued to him by the Police Department. Upon return of the badge, the Police Department shall refund the officer's deposit for the badge.


##### 3.28.200 - Uniforms.

Fees shall include an application fee and a permit fee. The permit fee shall vary in accordance with the size of garden plot used by the program participant and shall generally be based on a standard unit of one hundred square feet. Beginning January 1, 2005, the base application fee shall be Twenty-one Dollars ($21) per year for any size plot, and the base permit fee shall be Ten Dollars ($10) per year for each standard unit or any part of a standard unit. These base fees shall be subject to adjustments as authorized in subsections B, C and D of this section. The Director may waive fees and allow reductions from base fees as authorized in subsections E and F of this section.
2. The Director shall adjust the base fees every two (2) years approximately in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, published by the federal government, or a substitute or successor index selected by the Director. The next such adjustment shall take effect January 1, 2007.
3. The Director also may increase base fees for any year to reflect actual or expected increases in operating costs, including but not limited to water, lease fees, or equipment maintenance, provided that neither the base application fee nor the base permit fee for a standard unit shall vary by more than five per cent (5%) from the respective fee that would apply under subsections A and B of this section.
4. The Director may establish reduced base application fees or base permit fees, or both, for plots substantially smaller than a standard unit, including accessible raised beds, so long as the total base fees per square foot are no less than an amount generally consistent with the total base fees per square foot for the standard unit.
5. The Director may accept a reduced permit fee from a participant who is given access to a plot after a significant portion of the growing season has expired, prorated to reflect the number of months remaining in the growing season.
6. The Director may waive application fees or permit fees, or both, or set reduced fees, for plots used by low-income persons, and for organizations using plots dedicated to food bank gardening, otherwise operated to benefit low-income persons, or dedicated to educational purposes. If the Director waives or reduces fees under this section, the Director shall adopt policies regarding the income levels eligible for waivers or reduced fees, the types of organizations and programs eligible for such waivers or reductions, and conditions of eligibility, consistent with the intended public purposes for such waivers and reductions. The Director may limit the amount of area for which specified waivers or reductions may be allowed in order to prevent undue impacts on the revenues of the program.
