The Seattle Human Resources Director is authorized to develop and implement a temporary employment service to provide temporary workers to City employing units upon request therefor and upon payment by the requesting employing unit of the cost of such service.

### 4.04.060 - Emergency rules.

1.

8. Employees may engage in political activities, subject to RCW 41.06.250. Political activities of employees in operations which are financed primarily or totally by federal grant-in-aid funds are also subject to the Hatch Act, 15 USC/1501, et seq.

3. An employee's participation in a program-sponsored mediation, facilitated conversation or related activity shall be confidential to the extent permitted under state and federal laws.
4. It is the policy of the City that participation in the program shall be on a voluntary basis. Participation in the program is not intended to deprive employees of their ability to exercise any other contractual or legal rights to seek resolution of their concerns.

The public hearing will be on the effectiveness of the City's police accountability system and should be held at least ninety (90) days before the City begins collective bargaining agreement negotiations with the Seattle Police Officer's Guild (SPOG) or the Seattle Police Management Association (SPMA) or any successor labor organization. The City's Director of Labor Relations shall inform the Labor Policy Committee and Public Safety, Human Services and Education Committee at least one hundred and eighty (180) days before negotiations begin of the projected date for the start of the negotiations to enable the Council to timely schedule the hearing.
7. The City of Seattle will consider in good faith whether and how to carry forward the interests expressed at the public hearing. Those suggested changes that are legally required to be bargained with the SPOG, SPMA or their successor labor organizations will be considered by the City, in good faith, for inclusion in negotiations but the views expressed in the public hearing will not dictate the city's position during bargaining.

To the extent practical under the City budget, the Director shall offer career counseling and job-related training:


1. To assist interested employees in competing for better positions; and
2. To assist departments in identifying employees who are interested in upward mobility and in encouraging their progress.

### 4.04.220 - Layoff.

1. Order of Layoff. Within an employing unit, the order for layoff in a given class shall be as follows:

    1. Probationary employees;
    2. Trial service employees;
    3. Regular employees; Provided, that temporary workers and interim employees shall be separated prior to the layoff of any probationary or trial service employee s in the same employing unit and class. Trial service employees who cannot be reverted in accordance with SMC 4.04.300(B) shall be separated prior to the layoff of any regular employees.

    Among regular employees, order of layoff shall be in order of seniority until a performance evaluation system as contemplated by this chapter is in effect. Thereafter, the regular employee having the lowest performance evaluation in the class shall be laid off first, but among employees whose performance is substantially the same, layoff shall be in the order of seniority.

    In the event one (1) or more positions having different budget and class titles or having budget titles only and no class titles are scheduled to be abrogated for any reason and such abrogation will result in a layoff, the Director shall establish an order of layoff for regular employees that reflects their relative seniority in positions with the same budget title as such positions affected by the layoff.

2. Exceptions to Normal Order of Layoff.

    1. Upon a showing by the appointing authority that the operating needs of an employing unit require such action, the Director may authorize an exception to the normal order of layoff and the retention in active employment of any employee who has some special experience, training or skill which is exceptional to the knowledges, skills and abilities expected of the population of employees for the positions affected by the layoff. Such exceptions to the normal order of layoff may be based upon documented recruiting and/or hiring specifications, current job descriptions or similar documentation acceptable to the Director.
    2. The Director shall modify the normal order of layoff in the smallest respect sufficient to prevent a negative disparate impact upon women, the disabled, or minorities when these conditions are present:

        1. Five (5) or more employees in an Equal Employment Opportunity job category are to be laid off at one time in an employing unit;
        2. The Director determines that women, the disabled, or minorities are substantially underrepresented in the EEO category affected by the layoff, or that any such protected group would become substantially underrepresented in the EEO category as a result of a layoff in normal order; and
        3. A layoff in the normal order should have a negative disparate impact on any such protected group; provided, that no such modification shall affect a regular employee unless all probationary employees in the affected class or assignment level have been laid off.
        4. For purposes of this permitted modification of the normal order of layoff, an impact upon minorities shall be evaluated, and corrective action shall be taken, for minorities as a single group that shall not be divided by ethnicity or other subclassifications.
3. Employee Options For Transfers to Avoid Layoff (Bumping). Insofar as the option is available, as determined by the Director, any regular employee subject to being laid off may displace within the same employing unit the employee who has the least seniority in the displacing employee's class, or if the order of layoff reflects seniority within a budget title pursuant to SMC Section 4.04.220 A above, in the displacing employee's budget title.

The least-senior regular employee or a trial service employee who cannot be reverted in accordance with SMC 4.04.300(B) who is laid off or is displaced pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph may displace the employee having the least seniority in the next lower class in a class series, or next lower budget title when (1) the displacing employee has had an appointment to such lower class or budget title, and (2) the employee to be sequentially displaced has less seniority than the displacing employee.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, in all cases, to be eligible to displace another employee in order to avoid a layoff, the displacing employee must possess the skills required to perform the duties of the position held by the employee who would be displaced.

4. Reinstatement.

    1. The names of all employees laid off from active employment shall be placed on a reinstatement list. Such list shall be for the class or budget title from which they have been laid off. The entire reinstatement list shall be sent to any appointing authority for use in filling a vacancy in a position of that class or budget title. An appointing authority may refuse to make an appointment from the reinstatement list only upon stating a reason therefor to the Director.
    2. The Director may implement programs to refer laid-off employees to vacant City positions in any employing unit; provided, that each referred employee shall possess skills commensurate with the duties of the position to be filled, as determined by the Director, and provided, further, that no such referral shall result in a promotion for the affected employee unless the employee has been referred as a result of an appropriate qualifications audit. An appointing authority may refuse to hire a person so referred only upon stating, in writing, a reason therefor to the Director.
5. Notice of Layoff. Where a regular employee or a trial service employee is separated by reason of layoff, when possible, thirty (30) days' prior written notice shall be given the affected employee, and at least fifteen (15) days' prior written notice shall be given unless:

    1. Delaying the layoff would cause the employing unit to exceed its revenue for personal services for the affected work or program; or
    2. The layoff is one of a number of layoffs and delaying the layoff would cause serious financial detriment to the City; or
    3. The layoff is caused by fire, storm damage, earthquake, destruction of property, strike, or any other such event that could not reasonably have been foreseen, or by peremptory state or federal legislation.

### 4.04.230 - Progressive discipline.

When the appointing authority determines in accordance with personnel rules to impose a suspension, demotion or discharge in response to an act of employee misconduct or inappropriate job performance, he or she shall provide such determination in writing to the employee.

3. In order of increasing severity, the disciplinary actions which a supervisor may recommend and the appointing authority may approve against an employee include:
4. Suspension up to thirty (30) calendar days;
5. Demotion; and
6. Discharge.

8. The Seattle Human Resources Director may establish rules for application of discipline that are consistent for like behavior from department to department. A department may impose a more severe penalty than is otherwise sanctioned where misconduct which may be of minimal significance to other departments has a substantial impact on the operations, costs, or safety within that department.
9. An appointing authority who takes a disciplinary action that is subject to appeal to the Civil Service Commission shall inform the employee in writing that he or she has the right to file a grievance, followed by an appeal to the Civil Service Commission, in accordance with subsections 4.04.240 D and 4.04.260 B.

In no event shall an employee submit the same grievance under more than one recognized grievance procedure.
4. The head of the department shall inform the employee, in writing, of the outcome of the grievance. Such communication shall include notice of the employee's right to appeal to the Civil Service Commission within 20 days in accordance with section 4.04.260.

    1. the worker's current assignment has exceeded the hours limitation associated with it (i.e., one thousand forty (1,040) hours for a less-than-half-time assignment and one (1) year for a short-term assignment) and the worker believes he or she is performing an ongoing body of work; or
    2. the worker is one (1) of two (2) or more workers who are assigned substantially the same work in the same department and the worker believes the assignments should be aggregated and assigned to one (1) (or more) regular position(s).
3. If the outcome of the appeal process is the conversion of the temporary assignment(s) to a new or vacant regular position, the temporary worker shall be assigned to the position on an interim basis and receive compensation and fringe benefits as provided at SMC 4.20.055 until an internal competitive hiring process is completed. Such process shall take into account and give substantial weight to the experience of the temporary worker performing the work of the position on an interim basis.

The reasons for the dismissal shall be filed with the Seattle Human Resources Director.
4. An employee dismissed during their probationary period shall not have the right to appeal the dismissal.

If a vacancy is to be filled in a department and a valid Reversion Recall List for the classification for that vacancy contains the name(s) of eligible employees who have been removed from the payroll from that classification and from that department, such employees shall be reinstated in order of their length of service in that classification. The employee who has the most service in that classification shall be the first reinstated.
8. An employee whose name is on a valid Reversion Recall List for a specific job classification who accepts employment with the City in that same job classification shall have their name removed from the Reversion Recall List. Refusal to accept placement from a Reversion Recall List to a position the same, or essentially the same, as that which the employee previously held shall cause an employee's name to be removed from the Reversion Recall List, which shall terminate rights to reemployment under this Reversion Recall List provision.

After such hearing, the Commission may affirm the action of the appointing authority, or if it shall find that the action was not made in good faith for cause, shall order the immediate reinstatement or reemployment of such person in the office, place, position or employment from which such person was removed, suspended, demoted, or discharged. The Commission upon such hearing, in lieu of affirming the removal, may modify the order of removal, suspension, demotion, or discharge by directing a suspension, without pay, for up to thirty (30) days, and subsequent restoration to duty, or demotion in classification, grade or pay.

City officers and employees will demonstrate the values of integrity in the performance of the City's business, accountability to the law and to the people we serve, stewardship of the City's resources, and independence in the performance of our jobs.

        1. the covered individual;
        2. an immediate family member of the covered individual;

        4. a person the covered individual serves as an officer, director, trustee, partner or employee;
        5. a person with which the covered individual is seeking or has an arrangement concerning future employment.
    2. Participate in a matter in which a person that employed the covered individual in the preceding 12 months, or retained the covered individual or his or her firm or partnership in the preceding 12 months, has a financial interest; provided, however, that the Executive Director shall waive this section when:

        1. the covered individual's appointing authority or the authority's designee makes a written determination that there is a compelling City need for the covered individual to participate in a matter involving a prior employer or client, and submits that determination with a written plan showing how the authority will safeguard the City's interests, and
        2. the Executive Director determines that the authority's plan is satisfactory.

Use or attempt to use, or permit the use of any City funds, property, or personnel, for a purpose which is, or to a reasonable person would appear to be, for other than a City purpose, except as permitted by Section 4.16.071; provided, that nothing shall prevent the private use of City property which is available on equal terms to the public generally (such as the use of library books or tennis courts), the use of City property in accordance with municipal policy for the conduct of official City business (such as the use of a City automobile), if in fact the property is used appropriately; or the use of City property for participation of the City or its officials in activities of associations that include other governments or governmental officials;
    3.

This subsection G instead applies to all other members of advisory committees. No member of an advisory committee to whom this subsection applies shall:

        1. Have a financial interest, direct or indirect, personally or through a member of his or her immediate family, in any matter upon which the member would otherwise act or participate in the discharge of his or her official duties, and fail to disqualify himself or herself from acting or participating in the matter.
        2. Engage or have engaged in any transaction or activity which would to a reasonable person appear to be in conflict with or incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties, or which would to a reasonable person appear to impair the member's independence of judgment or action in the performance of official duties, without fully disclosing on the public record of the advisory committee the circumstances of the transaction or activity giving rise to such an appearance before engaging in the performance of such official duties. Such a member shall also file with the Commission a full written disclosure of the circumstances giving rise to such an appearance before engaging in such official duties. If such prior written filing is impractical, the member shall file such a disclosure as soon as practical.

4.

If the Executive Director does so dismiss the complaint, he or she shall do so in writing, setting forth the facts and the provisions of law upon which the dismissal is based, and shall provide a copy of the written dismissal to the complainant, to the person named in the complaint as the alleged violator and to the Commission. A complainant may appeal a dismissal under this subsection to the Commission under rules promulgated by the Commission.
5. The Executive Director may, after investigation, seek an administrative dismissal of the complaint from the Commission when he or she determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:

    1. A violation occurred, but it was inadvertent or minor, but not both; or
    2. A violation occurred, but appropriate actions have been taken to address the allegedly unlawful conduct.
6. If, after investigation, the Executive Director has reason to believe that a material violation of Chapter 4.16 has occurred, the Executive Director shall initiate an enforcement proceeding by issuing to the alleged violator a charging document which includes the provisions of Chapter 4.16 allegedly violated and the conduct that constitutes the violation(s), and shall issue a copy of the charging document to the Commission. The Director shall schedule a hearing to commence within 60 days of the charging document. The Commission Chair may, at any time, continue the hearing to another date. No hearing shall be scheduled, however, while an Executive Director's recommendation for a settlement is awaiting action by the Commission.
7. The Commission shall issue a written determination stating whether the chapter has been violated and setting forth the facts and the provisions of law upon which this determination is based. A copy of said determination shall be delivered to the complainant, if any, to the person charged with the violation and, where appropriate, to the person's superior.
8. All hearings hereunder shall be conducted as "contested case" hearings under the Administrative Code, Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02 (Ordinance 102228) and the Commission's rules and regulations. All hearings under this section shall be open to the public unless closed upon the request of the City employee who is the subject of the charges being heard, except that all hearings on charges against (1) City officials elected by the public, (2) the Deputy Mayor, if any, (3) heads of departments and Executive Department offices, (4) members of boards and commissions, and (5) those City employees who are represented by a labor union that, on the date the charges were filed, had not reached written agreement with the City concerning closing hearings on request, shall be open to the public. Regardless of whether the hearing was closed, if the Commission determines this chapter was violated, the charges, all recordings or transcripts of hearings that were made by the Commission, and the Commission's written findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be made public.
9. If the Commission determines that a City officer or employee has violated the provisions of this chapter, the Commission may recommend that the officer or employee be subject to disciplinary action. In addition to any other penalty herein or otherwise provided by law, a violation shall be cause for suspension, discharge, or removal from office, or such other disciplinary action as may, by the appropriate City authority, be deemed necessary and proper, and consistent with personnel ordinances and rules. A written report of the disciplinary action taken as a result of the Commission recommendation shall be made by the appropriate City authority to the Commission within 14 calendar days after receipt of the Commission's recommendation; provided, that this section shall not derogate from employee rights under any collective bargaining agreement or City personnel ordinance, or rules promulgated thereunto. If the appropriate City authority determines that the written report of disciplinary action taken as a result of the Commission recommendation required in the section cannot be made to the Commission within 14 calendar days after receipt of the Commission's recommendation, because of procedures prescribed under any collective bargaining agreement, personnel ordinance, or rule promulgated thereunto, the appropriate City authority shall so report to the Commission within 14 calendar days after receipt of the Commission's recommendation, stating the date on which the written report of disciplinary action taken will be submitted to the Commission. If the violation involves prohibited conduct of a former officer or employee, the Commission may recommend to the administering City authority that no contract be made or that the contract be terminated and that proceedings be begun anew in order to prevent injury to the City or to avoid an unfair advantage accruing to a competitor by reason of the violation. Upon receipt of the written report of the disciplinary action taken, or in the event no report is received, the Commission shall review such matter and make such further recommendation as may be appropriate.

### 4.16.100 - Action on violation.

The Commission may take one (1) or more of the following actions for violation of any provision of Chapter 4.16:

Each act that violates one (1) or more provisions of Chapter 4.16 may constitute a separate violation. Violation may be proven by a preponderance of evidence, and need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.


1. Recommend prosecution or other remedy to the appropriate authorities;
2. Impose a monetary fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000) per violation or three (3) times the economic value of any thing sought or received in violation of Chapter 4.16, whichever is greater. Fines for a violation of SMC 4.16.070.6.a shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000). Fines for a violation of SMC 4.16.070.6.b shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250);
3. Require reimbursement for damages of up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) sustained by the City that were caused by the violation and were not recovered by the City;
4. Require reimbursement for costs, including reasonable investigative costs. Such reimbursement shall not exceed the amount of any monetary fine;
5. Recommend to the Mayor and the appropriate agency that they request the City Attorney to bring an action to cancel or rescind the result of action taken by the violator, upon a Commission finding that:

    1. The violation has substantially influenced the City action, and
    2. Interests of the City require cancellation or rescission.
6. In the case of a violation by a member of an advisory committee, the Commission may, in addition to taking any other action authorized by this section:

    1. Recommend that the member be censured or removed from his or her position on the advisory committee; and
    2. Recommend to the advisory committee that any finding or recommendation of the committee that has been substantially influenced by the violation be rescinded or reconsidered.

### 4.16.105 - Appeal of fine.

1. Except as provided in subsection F of this section, if the Commission imposes a monetary fine for violation of any provision of this chapter, the City officer or employee on whom the fine is imposed may appeal the fine, on the Commission's record, to the Seattle Municipal Court. The Seattle Municipal Court shall uphold the Commission's decision if it determines the Commission's decision was not for any arbitrary, capricious, or illegal reason, and the decision was supported by substantial evidence in the Commission's record. Otherwise, the Court shall modify, reverse, or remand the matter to the Commission, as the Court deems appropriate.
2. In order to appeal a monetary fine imposed under this chapter by the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission, the City officer or employee on whom the fine is imposed must file a notice of appeal with the Clerk of the Municipal Court, serve it upon The City of Seattle, and deliver a copy to the Executive Director of the Commission, all within twenty (20) days after the date of the Commission's decision. In order to file the notice of appeal, the City officer or employee must pay to the Clerk of the Municipal Court a filing fee in the amount set by statute or court rule for a civil action filed in the District Courts. The filing fee and the costs of preparing the record of the proceedings of the Commission may be taxed as costs against the nonprevailing party, as the Municipal Court may direct, but each party shall bear its own attorney's fees. The notice of appeal shall be in writing and shall include the mailing address and, if different, the street address where papers may be served on the appellant. The notice of appeal shall contain, in separate numbered paragraphs, statements of the specific findings of fact, conclusions of law, or aspects of the fine on which the appellant seeks review, the basis for the appeal, and a brief statement of the relief requested. The appellant shall attach a copy of the written decision of the Commission being appealed.
3. Within thirty (30) days after the notice of appeal has been properly filed, served, and a copy delivered to the Executive Director, the appellant shall provide the Executive Director with a record of proceedings, which the Executive Director shall, if it complies with this subsection, promptly file with the Municipal Court so as to present the issues raised for review. Upon payment of the costs of copying, the Executive Director shall provide the appellant a copy of the relevant papers and exhibits, which shall be included in the record. The record shall also include a transcript of those portions of the testimony that are designed by the appellant or by the Executive Director, who shall each designate what they believe necessary to resolve disputed issues. The appellant at his or her expense shall submit to the Executive Director for review and approval, if accurate, the transcript of the designated portions of the testimony, prepared by a certified court reporter. The typed transcript, when certified as accurate by the Executive Director, shall constitute the record for review of the portion so transcribed. If all or a designated part of a tape recording is not audible, the Executive Director may prepare and certify a summary of that portion of the testimony in the proceedings based on his or her notes and memory. Where the Executive Director and the appellant agree that the testimony or facts are not in dispute, they may jointly prepare a narrative report of some or all of the evidence or a summary of some or all of the testimony in order to reduce the amount of material transcribed and to make a more compact record.
4. Except where inconsistent with this section, the procedural rules of the Civil Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction (CRLJs), as they may be amended from time to time, shall govern procedure related to the appeal in the Municipal Court, but no new evidence may be submitted to or taken by the Municipal Court.
5. The Municipal Court shall appoint a judge pro tempore to hear appeals by employees of the Municipal Court unless both the City employee and the Executive Director agree that a regular Municipal Court judge may hear the case.
6. This section shall not apply to (1) City officials elected by the public, (2) the Deputy Mayor, if any, (3) heads of departments and Executive Department offices, and (4) those City employees who are represented by a labor union that, on the date the charges were filed had not reached written agreement with the City regarding the appeal to Municipal Court of monetary fines imposed by the Commission. Persons for whom an appeal to Seattle Municipal Court is not authorized by this section may seek review of a monetary fine imposed by the Commission in King County Superior Court as provided in state law.

1. "Administrative reassignment" means paid leave status which an appointing authority may authorize for any City officer or employee in his or her department or office, when such employee is the cause of or subject of, or otherwise significantly affected by an active official investigatory process related to alleged violations of personnel rules, City ordinances, or state or federal laws and/or regulations, or an investigation intended to determine the employee's fitness for duty. Administrative reassignment shall not be considered discipline.

The appointing authority of each City department or his/her designated management representative for this purpose shall have the sole authority to make an administrative reassignment of an employee when, and only when, such employee's absence from his or her regular work unit is deemed to be in the best business interest of the department, and there is no other work unit to which the employee can be assigned. Administrative reassignment may only be made after the appointing authority determines that it is the only reasonable course of action available within the department for such employee. The appointing authority shall complete the investigation as expeditiously as possible to limit the length of the administration reassignment.
3. In each instance where administrative reassignment has been authorized, the appointing authority shall record the circumstances and/or business justification necessitating the reassignment. Such documentation shall be reasonably available to the Seattle Human Resources Director for purposes of assessing and evaluating use patterns. The Seattle Human Resources Director shall provide a summary report of the use of administrative reassignment to the City Council on a regular basis.

#### 4.20.070 - Effective date of salary increase.

Any increase in salary based on service shall become effective upon the first day immediately following completion of the applicable period of service.

Salary step placement for employees affected by an employment action, classification action, or compensation action shall be calculated as provided below, except that incumbents in positions assigned to compensation programs under which the appointing authority retains discretion for all base salary placement decisions shall be excluded from the provisions of this section for purposes of movement between positions in the same program or between two (2) such programs.


1. Transfers. An employee transferred to another position in the same class or having an identical salary range shall continue to be compensated at the same rate of pay until the combined service requirement is fulfilled for a step increase, and shall thereafter receive step increases as provided in Section 4.20.040 until the maximum step is reached.
2. Promotions. An employee appointed to a position in a class having a higher maximum salary shall be paid at the appropriate step in the higher range which shall result in an increase in pay equivalent to at least one (1) salary step; provided that such increase shall not exceed the maximum step established for the higher paying position; provided further that this provision shall apply only to appointments of employees from regular full-time positions and shall not apply to appointments from positions designated as "intermittent" or "as needed," nor to temporary assignments providing pay "over regular salary while so assigned."
3. Demotions. An employee demoted because of inability to meet established performance standards from a regular full-time position to a position in a class having a lower salary range shall be paid the salary step in the lower range determined as follows:

An employee reduced because of organizational change or reduction in force from a regular full-time position to a position in a class having a lower salary range shall be paid the salary rate of the lower range which is nearest to the salary rate to which he was entitled in his former position without reduction provided that such salary shall in no event exceed the maximum salary of the lower range.

If an employee who has completed twenty-five (25) years of City service and who within five (5) years of a reduction in lieu of layoff to a position in a class having a lower salary range is again reduced in lieu of layoff to a position in a class having a lower salary range, such employee shall receive the salary he or she was receiving prior to such second reduction as an "incumbent" for so long as he or she remains in such position or until the regular salary for the lower class exceeds the "incumbent" rate of pay.


    1. If the rate of pay received in the higher class is above the maximum salary for the lower class, the employee shall receive the maximum salary of the lower range;
    2. If the rate of pay received in the higher class is within the salary range for the lower class, the employee shall receive that salary rate for the lower class which, without increase, is nearest to the salary rate to which such employee was entitled in the higher class; provided that the employee shall receive not less than the minimum salary of the lower range.
4. Reclassifications. When a position is reclassified by ordinance to a new or different class having a different salary range the employee occupying the position immediately prior to and at the time of the reclassification shall receive the salary rate which shall be determined in the same manner as for a promotion; provided, that if the employee's salary prior to reclassification is higher than the maximum salary of the range for such new or different class, he shall continue to receive such higher salary as an "incumbent" for so long as he remains in such position or until the regular salary for the classification exceeds the "incumbent" rate of pay.
5. Change in the Number of Steps Assigned to a Salary Range. When the number of steps in a salary range is changed, the incumbent of a position affected by such change shall receive the salary step of the new salary range that is closest to the pay rate he or she most recently received in the prior range, without reduction, not to exceed the maximum step of the new range. Time served in both ranges will count toward the next salary step increment.

Where the dollar amount specified for the salary step attained, on or by December 31, 1988, by any such employee is the same as any salary step of the new salary range associated with the position of employment held by such employee as of January 1, 1989, such employee shall be placed at, and treated as having attained, that equal dollar amount-salary step in the new salary range. Any such employee who had not attained, on or by December 31, 1988, the top step of such employee's former salary range shall be provided, as of such employee's next anniversary date, a step increase within such employee's new salary range so long as one (1) or more additional salary steps within the new salary range can be attained.

Each such employee shall be provided a step increase (a) after six (6) months of actual service, where such employee is placed at the first step of the new salary range; or (b) after one (1) additional year of actual service, where such employee is placed at any step other than either the first or top step of the new salary range; provided, that any employee who will receive a smaller total 1989 salary increase through implementation of the ordinance codified in this section than he/she would have received without the upgrade provided hereby, shall be provided an additional step increase on his/her 1989 anniversary date.

Where the dollar amount specified for the salary step attained, on or by the day immediately preceding the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, by any such employee is greater than the top step of the new salary range associated with the position of employment held by such employee as of the effective date of said ordinance, such employee shall continue to receive such higher salary as an "incumbent" for so long as he/she remains in such position or until the regular salary for such position exceeds the "incumbent" rate of pay; and each such employee shall also receive whatever 1989 general increase in salary is provided to other employees listed in Exhibit B.

    1. If the employee's actual rate of pay is within the salary range of the applicable position title, standby pay shall be computed on his or her actual rate of pay.
    2. If the employee's actual rate of pay is higher than that top step of the salary range of the applicable position title, standby pay shall be computed using the top step of the salary range of the applicable position title.
    3. If the employee's actual rate of pay is lower than the first step of the salary range of the applicable position title, standby pay shall be computed using the first step of the salary range of the applicable position title.

There is no cap or maximum limit on the number of hours a LEOFF 1 member may accumulate in his/her bank. LEOFF 1 members who transfer to other City departments may convert a maximum of 72 Dependent Care and Safe Leave hours to traditional sick leave for use authorized under Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.24 to the new position in the accepting department.

### Subchapter II - Retirement Accounts
#### 4.24.200 - Establishment of account.

Upon the retirement of any member of the City Employees' Retirement System or any Health Department employee who has retained membership in the State Retirement System under Ordinance 83017, or upon the award of a retirement allowance in accordance with Section 13(c) of Ordinance 78444 to a member whose employment with the City has been terminated by layoff, or, at the election of a member of such system, upon retirement after transfer of such member to another governmental entity under any agreement for merger or consolidation of governmental services between the City and such other governmental entity, the Board of Administration of the City Employees' Retirement System shall establish for such member an account to which it shall credit an amount equal to twenty-five (25) percent of such employee's unused and accumulated sick leave, while employed by the City, at the rate of pay of such member in effect on the day prior to his retirement or layoff, as the case may be.

Such account shall be used only to pay health care benefit premiums of such member and spouse at the time of retirement or award of such retirement allowance, to such carrier or carriers as shall be designated by such member. The Board of Administration shall pay such health care benefit premiums from the Health Care Fund, charge the respective members' accounts in the amount thereof, and cease payments on behalf of any such member when the balance in his or her account has been exhausted, or upon the deaths of such member and spouse, whichever shall occur first. The Board of Administration shall periodically notify the departments from which members are retired or laid off and for whom such health care premiums have been paid, of the amount of premiums so paid and the Health Care Fund shall be reimbursed for such premium payments from the proper funds. Upon written request of a participating member at any time after retirement, the remaining balance of such member's account may be paid to said member and the Board of Administration shall cease payment of health care benefit premiums for said member. In the event of the member's death, his or her designated beneficiary may request and receive a refund of any remaining account balance.


#### 4.24.210 - Payment or deferral of sick leave upon retirement.

In lieu of the establishment of the account and the crediting thereto of the amount provided in Section 4.24.200, any such member of the City Employees' Retirement System or Health Department employee who has retained membership in the State Retirement System under Ordinance 87017, upon retirement, award of retirement allowance in accordance with Section 13(c) of Ordinance 78441 to a member whose employment with the City has been terminated by layoff, or upon retirement after transfer of such member to another governmental entity under any agreement for merger or consolidation of governmental services between the City and such other governmental entity, as the case may be, may choose one of the options provided in subsection A with respect to his or her unused and accumulated sick leave, unless such member is subject to the mandatory sick leave deferral provisions in subsection B.


1. Optional Cash-Out or Deferral for Retirement Income Benefits. The eligible retiring member may by written notice to the head of the City department in which such member is employed, and subject to the provisions of the City of Seattle's Voluntary Deferred Compensation 457 Plan and Trust ("City's 457 Plan and Trust") maintained pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code Section 4.38.010 and the applicable federal income tax laws and regulations governing the deferral of payments for unused and accumulated sick leave under such plan, elect one of the following two options:

    1. To receive a lump sum cash payment from the City equal to twenty-five (25) percent of such member's unused and accumulated sick leave balance, determined at the rate of pay of such member in effect on the day prior to his or her retirement; or
    2. To defer receipt of thirty-five (35) percent of such member's unused and accumulated sick leave balance, determined at the rate of pay of such member in effect on the day prior to his or her retirement, to the City's 457 Plan and Trust adopted and maintained pursuant to Section 4.38.010; provided, that:

        1. Such deferral election is made before the member retires and while employed by the City in accordance with the City's 457 Plan and Trust;
        2. Such deferral shall be subject to all conditions and limitations of the City's 457 Plan and Trust; and
        3. When the deferral of thirty-five (35) percent of the value of the member's unused and accumulated sick leave balance to the City's 457 Plan and Trust adopted and maintained pursuant to Section 4.38.010 would exceed the year-to-date or life-to-date limitations on deferrals and contributions to such account, the member's deferral to the pre-tax deferral account will be automatically reduced to the maximum allowable deferral amount, and the member shall then receive a lump sum taxable cash payment from the City equal to the amount, if any, by which a twenty-five (25) percent cash out payment under subsection A1 for such member exceeds the maximum allowable deferral to under the City's 457 Plan and Trust under subsection A2.
2. Mandatory Deferral for Health Benefits. If the retiring member is a represented employee covered by an agreement by and between the City and an individual union that is part of the Coalition of City Unions that has been ratified by the employees in the union who are eligible to retire during the term of the agreement and which requires the City to make contributions to the City's duly established Health Reimbursement Arrangement—Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association Program ("HRA-VEBA") as authorized and established under 26. U.S.C. § 501(c)(9) on behalf of all members covered by such agreement who retire during the duration of such agreement, the City shall, following the receipt of a signed hold harmless agreement and membership enrollment form, contribute thirty-five (35) percent of such member's unused sick leave balance, determined at the rate of pay of such member in effect on the day prior to his or her retirement, to a pre-tax deferral account established and maintained for the benefit of the member under the City's HRA-VEBA Program, to provide reimbursements for qualifying medical care expenses in accordance with the terms of the HRA-VEBA Program and applicable federal income tax laws and regulations. If the retiring member to whom subsection B is applicable fails to submit the signed hold harmless agreement and membership enrollment form by their last working day of employment, the retiring member will forfeit his or her entire unused and accumulated sick leave balance. Under no circumstances shall any retiring member to whom subsection B applies be eligible to elect either of the options provided under subsection A or have the right to receive payment from the City of all or any portion of the value of his or her unused and accumulated sick leave in the form of a cash payment or other taxable or non-taxable benefits.
3. Authorization for Payment. Upon receipt of a written notice from a retiring member pursuant to subsection A, or receipt of a signed hold harmless agreement and membership form from a retiring member to whom subsection B is applicable, the head of the department in which such person was employed shall pay such amount to or on behalf of such person and for such purpose to use unexpended and unencumbered budget salary funds accumulating in the budget of such department, or such other funds as may be appropriated therefor.
4. Eligibility Date. Mandatory Deferral for Health Benefits under Section B was previously authorized for the Coalition of City Unions by Ordinance No. 115334 and employees became eligible in accordance with the terms of the City's HRA-VEBA program. Optional Cash-Out or Deferral for Retirement Income Benefits under Section A applies to employees who retire on or after the effective date of Ordinance 122251.

#### 4.24.220 - Notification of unused sick leave and rates of pay

The Seattle Human Resources Director of the City, or other responsible boards or commissions shall notify the Board of Administration of the City Employees' Retirement System in writing of the unused and accumulated sick leave and the applicable hourly rate of pay of retiring members of the retirement system.


#### 4.24.230 - Administration.

The Board of Administration of the City Employees' Retirement System shall administer the provisions of this subchapter and may make necessary rules to effectuate the same.

2. Except as provided in subsection C, an employee who is separated from the payroll shall be paid in a lump sum for all of his/her accrued vacation credit even though such employee may not have been able to use such vacation credit because of his/her ineligibility to do so pursuant to SMC Section 4.34.045; provided, that in the event such separation occurs as a consequence of the death of the employee, such payment shall be made to the employee's beneficiary.

### 4.34.100 - Accrual rate—Temporary employees acquiring permanent status.

1. Settlement Agreement. This section implements the Settlement Agreement dated June 5, 1989, in the case of Scannell v. The City of Seattle, King County Superior Court Cause No. 844600, and should be interpreted and applied accordingly.
2. Transition from Temporary to Permanent Status. For temporary employees who acquire permanent employee status the vacation accrual rate will be determined as follows:

    1. Those Becoming Permanent Employees Before January 1, 1982. The vacation accrual rate for former temporary employees who became permanent employees before January 1, 1982, is based on calendar years of service until January 1, 1982 (effective date of 1982 amended vacation ordinance). Temporary employees who became permanent employees retained their vacation accrual rate earned in temporary service and continued to earn credit toward higher vacation accrual rates based on years of service until January 1, 1982. After January 1, 1982, they are entitled to receive subsequent increases in accrual rates based on cumulative hours worked from date of hire, as provided in the City's vacation ordinance, Chapter 4.34.
    2. Those Becoming Permanent Between January 1, 1982, and August 1, 1984. The vacation accrual rate for former temporary employees who became permanent employees between January 1, 1982, and August 1, 1984 (the effective date of the 1984 amended vacation ordinance), is based on calendar years of service until the date they became permanent. After the date they became permanent, they retained their accrual rates earned in temporary service and are entitled to receive subsequent increases in accrual rates based on cumulative hours worked from date of hire, as provided in the City's vacation ordinance, Chapter 4.34.
    3. Those Becoming Permanent On or After August 1, 1984. Temporary employees who did not become permanent employees before August 1, 1984, accrued credit toward higher vacation accrual rates based on calendar years of service until August 1, 1984. On August 1, 1984, and thereafter, temporary employees and former temporary employees who became permanent employees after August 1, 1984, retain their vacation accrual rates earned in temporary service. After August 1, 1984, they are entitled to receive subsequent increases in accrual rates based on cumulative hours worked from date of hire, as provided in the City's vacation ordinance, Chapter 4.34.
3. Accrual Rate. Employees within subsection B of this section retain any accrual rate attained based on calendar years of service and there will be no reduction in their accrual rate as a result of this transition from calculating vacation accrual based on calendar years to accrual based on cumulative hours worked. Cumulative hours worked for accrual purposes will be based on total hours from last hire date, times a multiplier of 1.135 to account for paid leave which the employee did not receive and paid leave for which premium pay may be substituted.
4. Transitional Adjustment. Temporary employees and permanent employees who were formerly temporaries whose vacation premium pay or vacation credits were calculated without including the employees' previous temporary service, or were not increased in accordance with the vacation accrual rates specified herein, shall receive additional vacation pay or vacation credits based on the accrual rates set forth in subsection B of this section. The City shall receive credit for the actual amount of vacation premium pay or vacation previously received by the employee.
5. Break in service. The accrual rate increases in this section are based on employment with the City without a voluntary break in service. For vacation accrual purposes, "voluntary break in service" must be greater than 30 days and is defined as a quit, resignation, service retirement, separation of temporary employee as shown in the employee's record, or failure to return from unpaid leave of absence. If an employee has not worked for at least one calendar year, a voluntary break in service is presumed.

### 4.36.530 - Membership—Temporary, interim, intermittent and part-time workers

This section and Section 4.36.575 provide the exclusive methods for temporary, interim, intermittent, provisional workers or workers in part-time positions of less than 20 hours per week over a one year period to become members of the retirement system.


1. Opportunities. A worker in active City service on and after January 1, 1989, who has a position that is classified as temporary, interim or intermittent, or a part-time position of less than 20 hours per week over a one year period, has the three following opportunities to join the retirement system:
2. Within six calendar months of completion of 1,044 hours of compensated straight-time service;
3. Within six calendar months of completion of five years (10,440 hours) of continuous compensated straight-time service.
For purposes of this section and Sections 4.36.555 and 4.36.575, "straight-time service" means regular hours worked, including premium hours but excluding paid overtime hours.

In addition to the opportunities described in this subsection, an employee is required to join the system upon appointment to an eligible full or part-time position unless the position is elective or exempt under Subsection 4.36.525.C or E or the worker has an election under a statutory right under Section 4.36.525.D.


1. Buy-in Option. If the worker elects to join the retirement system under subsections A.1 or A.2 of this section or becomes a member upon mandatory appointment to an eligible position, the worker may choose whether or not to acquire ("buy in") service credit for the hours of compensated service earned after first becoming eligible to join the system. These options are described in Section 4.36.575.
2. Exercise of Option. To exercise an option to join the retirement system, a worker must file the documents reasonably required by the Board of Administration before the expiration date.
3. Expiration. If not exercised, the opportunity to join the retirement system under subsection A1 of this section expires six calendar months after the worker becomes eligible; if not exercised, the opportunity under subsection A.2 expires six calendar months after the worker becomes eligible and such a worker may only become a member of the retirement system thereafter by appointment to an eligible full- or part-time position or by serving as an elective officer. If the opportunity under subsection A.2 of this section has expired, the worker shall not receive creditable service for his or her City service in a temporary, interim, intermittent position or a part-time position of less than 20 hours per week over a one year period.

### 4.36.535 - Exclusion from membership in retirement system

No City contractor, including any person employed by a City contractor, who is not paid directly through the City payroll process, not employed in a City position created or approved by ordinance, or not employed as a temporary worker pursuant to Section 4.04.045, shall be a member of the retirement system.


### 4.36.540 - Contributions—members

Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the contribution made and provided for in this section, and shall receipt in full for his or her salary or compensation. Payment less said contributions shall be a full and complete discharge of all claims and demands whatsoever for the service rendered by such person during the period covered by such payment, except his or her claim to the benefits to which he or she may be entitled under the provisions of this chapter.


1. Effective January 4, 2012, members of the retirement system shall make contributions to the retirement fund at the rate of 10.03 percent of the compensation of each such member, exclusive of overtime; provided that any member whose rate of contribution prior to June 23, 1972, was less than 6 percent and whose rate was increased by 2.03 percent pursuant to Ordinance 111303 shall have such rate further increased by 1 percent, exclusive of overtime, effective January 5, 2011, and by an additional 1 percent, exclusive of overtime, effective January 4, 2012; provided, further, that any reinstated member who has redeposited his/her withdrawn contributions plus interest as provided in subsection 4.36.567, who was a member of the retirement system at any time prior to June 23, 1972, and whose rate of contribution at such prior time was less than 6 percent and whose rate was increased by 2.03 percent of the compensation of such member pursuant to Ordinance 111303 shall have such rate further increased by 1 percent, exclusive of overtime, effective January 5, 2011, and by an additional 1 percent, exclusive of overtime, effective January 4, 2012.
2. Member contributions as provided in subsection 4.36.540.A shall be deducted by the Director of Finance and Administrative Services and shall be paid into the retirement fund, provided for in this chapter, and shall be credited by the Board together with regular interest.

### 4.36.545 - Contributions—City

The City shall match the normal contributions of members described in Section 4.36.540.A and provide for payment of the matching contributions into the retirement fund at the earliest time possible. The City shall also contribute, in excess of the matching contributions, the actuarially determined City contribution to provide the moneys necessary to guarantee benefits payable under Sections 4.36.605 and 4.36.650 as well as all other benefits allowable to members and their beneficiaries under the provisions of this chapter including death benefits, except such as are provided by the accumulated contributions and death benefit assessments of members. All contributions of the City from all of its departments are available for payment of obligations of the retirement system without segregation by employing departments.


### 4.36.550 - City obligations

1. The payments of the City due the retirement fund as provided for in this chapter are made obligations of the City except as provided in subsection B of this section. The Board shall annually, on or before the tenth day of July each year, prepare and submit to the City Council an estimate of the amounts necessary to meet such obligations, and the City Council shall provide for the raising of such amounts as are necessary to make such payments.
2. The City may at any time change, modify or repeal this chapter or any part thereof in respect to its future obligations to any member not at that time receiving or being eligible to a pension hereunder. It is specifically provided, however, and the City covenants and guarantees, that the City's obligation to those members receiving or eligible to a retirement allowance prior to such change, modification or repeal shall continue in full force and effect as provided in this chapter; and that the City's obligation to those members not receiving or being eligible to a pension at the time of such change, modification or repeal, will be a retirement allowance at pension age equal to the actuarial equivalent of the accumulated value of the member's contribution standing to his credit at date of pension, and the value of the City's obligation as actuarially determined under Section 4.36.545 to the date of such change, modification or repeal.

### 4.36.555 - Determination of creditable service

1. A member who has served continuously in a full-time position and not realized any time loss will accrue a creditable year of service for 12 months' service. No additional credit is given for Leap Year's Day.
2. For all other members, a creditable year of service is measured as 2,088 hours of compensated service at straight-time pay.
3. When shown on the City's payroll, paid vacation, sick leave, military leave, funeral leave, and, if the employee pays his or her contribution, "time loss" on worker's compensation or time during family and medical leave under Chapter 4.26, are counted. Overtime (whether or not paid), unpaid leave, time not worked during a layoff, strike or disciplinary suspension, and service as a volunteer are not counted. Service on a temporary City assignment to another government or organization may be counted, in the discretion of the Board, if the member or the member's employer pays the employee contribution.
4. Creditable service is calculated by an employee's hours or time worked, as certified by the Director of Finance and Administrative Services to the retirement system. When payroll records are available, the Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall multiply the hours worked by a temporary, interim, seasonal, or provisional worker and a worker in a part-time position of less than 20 hours per week over a one year period by a factor of 1.135 in reporting creditable service to the retirement system, to account for paid leave which was not received and for premium pay which may be substituted for paid leave. The Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall reduce the hours or days determined by application of the multiplier by the amount of any paid leave actually provided to the employee and counted in the hours or days worked.
5. No creditable service may accrue for City employment during which the City contributes to another retirement system on the employee's behalf or for a member's City employment after he or she retires on a service retirement and, except for the annual death benefit assessment, no deduction shall be made from his or her pay for retirement purposes.

### 4.36.560 - Estimate of length of service

If it shall be impracticable for the Board to determine from the records the length of service, the compensation, or the age of any member, the Board may estimate for the purpose of this chapter, such length of service, compensation or age.


### 4.36.565 - Modification of allowance for service

Subject to the following and all other provisions of this chapter, including such rules and regulations as the Board shall adopt in pursuance thereof, the Board, subject to the approval of the City Council, shall determine and may modify allowance for service.

Time during leave on account of sickness or injury, time during family and medical leave under Chapter 4.26, or time served in either the Police or Fire Departments, or time during which a member was under temporary or provisional appointment before becoming a member, or time during which a member was on extended leave of absence while serving as an officer of a labor organization the membership of which includes City employees, may be allowed in computing creditable service, provided such members shall pay into the retirement fund an amount equal to the normal contributions covering the period for which creditable service is claimed; and provided, further, that as to employees who commenced City service on or before December 31, 1987, the first six (6) months of such members' employment shall be allowed in computing creditable service without such payment. Time during which a member is absent on leave without pay for reasons other than those specified in this section shall not be allowed in computing creditable service.

Each member shall file with the Board such information affecting his or her status as a member of the retirement system as the Board may require.


### 4.36.567 - Purchase of creditable service

1. Redeposit of Creditable Service for eligible employees reentering City service who had previously withdrawn contributions as provided for in Section 4.36.665.

    1. Any member or former member who reenters City service may redeposit in the retirement fund an amount equal to that which he or she previously withdrew therefrom, or some part thereof, plus compound interest, at the actuarial assumed rate of investment return, which would have accumulated on the amount, as determined by the Board, between the date of his or her last termination of his or her membership and the date of redeposit. Within two years after his or her re-entry into City service, a former member must redeposit the entire sum determined to be due to purchase all, or part of, their former creditable service, or sign and file with the Board a redeposit contract in accord with subsection 4.36.567.B in order to reestablish all or part of his or her former creditable service. In the event such redeposit is made by a member, the City shall reinstate all or that part of the former creditable service purchased by the member.
    2. If a member within two years after reentering the retirement system after a termination of his or her membership does not make such a redeposit or file a properly executed redeposit contract, he or she may purchase all, or some part of, his or her former creditable service only by paying into the retirement fund the amount, or some part thereof, he or she previously withdrew plus compound interest as determined by the Board. The following provisions apply to redeposits made pursuant to this subsection 4.36.567.A.2:

        1. Determination of applicable interest rates. The interest rate for each year since the date of withdrawal of contributions shall be the greater of the rate the retirement fund has earned, net of fees, as reported by the Retirement System's Investment Performance Consultant, or the interest rate equivalent to the actuarial assumed rate of investment return at the time of executing the redeposit contract.
        2. Calculation of "accumulated contributions." For purposes of determining a member's accumulated contributions pursuant to Section 4.36.030, only a portion of the total amount deposited shall be considered. The portion to be considered as the member's accumulated contributions shall be only the amount previously withdrawn as the member's contributions including interest, plus interest calculated at the actuarial assumed rate of investment return.
        3. Withdrawal of contributions limited. The total amount deposited for the purchase of said former creditable service will be available for withdrawal by the member only if the member terminates employment with the City and withdraws his or her total accumulated contributions prior to retirement or dies and benefits are not payable under subsections 4.36.680.B and 4.36.680.C. In the event such redeposit is made by a member, his rate of contribution shall be as determined under subsection 4.36.540.A, and the City shall reinstate all, or that part of, the former creditable service purchased by the member.
2. Purchase of Creditable Service

    1. Unless otherwise stated, members allowed to purchase creditable service pursuant to Chapter 4.36 shall pay, as a single lump sum payment at the time of retirement, the actuarial present value of the resulting increase in their benefit as provided in this subsection 4.36.567.B.1.

        1. The actuarial present value shall be calculated by the Retirement Board using the current actuarial assumptions as approved by the Retirement Board.
        2. For purposes of determining the member's accumulated contributions pursuant to Section 4.36.030, only a portion of the total amount deposited shall be considered. The portion to be considered as the member's accumulated contributions shall be calculated at the employee's current hourly rate times the current contribution rate times the number of hours to be purchased.
        3. If a member elects to pay at resignation from City service, the actuarial present value will be estimated at the time of resignation and adjusted at retirement for factors existing at the time of retirement, if necessary, according to rules established by the Retirement Board.
        4. In the event such payment is made by a member, the City shall consider such City service previously rendered as creditable service for the member.
    2. Unless otherwise stated, the purchase price for the purchase of creditable service must be paid in full to the retirement fund prior to the time of resignation from City service or retirement, whichever occurs first.
3. Redeposit and Purchase Contracts. These terms and conditions govern redeposit contracts for reentering City officers and employees, deposit contracts of officers and employees joining the system under subsections C, E and F of Section 4.36.525 and the purchase of creditable service for past City service.

    1. The unpaid balance shall accrue interest at the assumption rate established by the Board for actuarial purposes and in effect at the time the redeposit agreement is signed;
    2. The redeposit must be completed within ten years from the date of the member's re-entry into City service;
    3. After deducting any immediate redeposit, the balance shall be payable in approximately equal installments every pay period, computed by amortizing interest over the contract term, unless the Board by rule authorizes redeposit in installments of equal payments of principal with interest computed on declining balances;
    4. Installment payments shall be deducted from the member's pay during each pay period; and
    5. Redeposit agreements shall be subject to the approval of the Board. The Board of Administration in its discretion may include supplemental terms and conditions by rule or by approving a form of agreement on the following subjects, among others:

        1. A minimum installment payment per pay period;
        2. The deferral of a redeposit of an installment during a member's layoff, military leave, or other approved leave, with catch-up redeposits upon the member's resumption of pay status;
        3. Allocation of payments between interest and principal;
        4. Appropriate arrangements in the event of a member's suspension or separation from City service, including the making of set-offs, acceleration of payments, continuation of payments from other sources during the interim, or adjusting creditable service being purchased on a pro-rata basis;
        5. Other terms and conditions as the Board may deem appropriate.

### 4.36.570 - Purchase of creditable service for initial six months of City service for employees hired during 1988 through 1998 period

Buy-back. Employees who were hired during the period 1988 through 1998 who have not purchased creditable service for the initial six months of employment may purchase said creditable service by paying into the retirement fund, at the time of resignation or retirement from City service, the actuarial present value of the resulting increase in their benefit. The terms and conditions of purchase shall be in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 4.36.567 B.


### 4.36.575 - Buy-in of creditable service by temporary, interim, intermittent, provisional and part-time workers

These terms and conditions apply to workers acquiring ("buying in") creditable service under Section 4.36.530 for earlier work in temporary, interim, intermittent and provisional positions or part-time positions of less than 20 hours per week during the course of the year.


1. Eligible Services. The first 1,044 hours of City service are not eligible for purchase of creditable service. Only hours in continuous City service as shown on City payrolls can be counted subject to the multiplier in Section 4.36.555. A break in the continuity of City service excludes hours before the break. Such a break in on-call, seasonal or intermittent service occurs if a worker:

    1. Removes his or her name from a roster or listing for work assignments;
    2. In seasonal employment, declines the opportunity to work for a season; or, in other employment, fails to work at least 100 hours in any 12 month period;
    3. Takes other actions indicating that he or she has stopped or suspended for a year providing his or her services to the City; or
    4. Is discharged from City employment.
2. Amount of Creditable Service. Creditable service shall be granted only for the hours for which both the worker and the City make contributions to the retirement system at the rate contemplated by Section 4.36.540. To receive creditable service for prior City service, such a worker shall deposit into the retirement system an amount determined by the Board of Administration equal to the sum, or some part thereof, that he or she would have paid had he or she become a member when first eligible and had deductions been made from his or her pay warrants, through the years, for creditable service, together with interest thereon. Interest shall accrue at the Board's assumption rate established for actuarial purposes from the date of the wage or salary payment to the date of deposit and shall be compounded annually.
3. Waiting Period, Service Before 1988. A worker, who began his or her continuous City service on or before December 31, 1987 and has not already received such credit, shall receive creditable service for the first 1,044 hours, or portion thereof, of continuous service that he or she worked before January 1, 1988. This is a transitional exception to subsection B of Section 4.36.530.
4. Administration. The Board, in its discretion, may delegate to the Executive Director the calculation of the amount of contribution for such a worker to acquire ("buy in") in prior creditable service and may authorize its Executive Director to use an approximate formula to simplify computations and/or to determine credit for vacation and other paid leave when City records are not available therefor. For example, for hourly workers, who have held the same or similar positions over the duration of the buy-back period, the Board may determine the amount due by:

    1. Classifying the worker's creditable hours by the contribution rate in effect at the time the hours were worked;
    2. Multiplying the creditable hours in each rate classification by the worker's current hourly wage rate and by the applicable contribution rate; and
    3. Adding the total of the products of all such classifications together.
5. Deposit Contract. The Board may authorize such a worker to make his or her deposit under an agreement for installment payments under the following terms and conditions:

    1. The deposit must be completed within ten years from the date of the member's eligibility to join the retirement system.
    2. After deducting any immediate deposits, the balance shall be payable in approximately equal amortized installments unless the Board authorizes otherwise. Installments shall be deducted from the worker's pay whenever practical. By rule the Board may establish a minimum initial deposit and allowable installment payment and may include other appropriate terms and conditions in the agreement.
    3. A member may accelerate and prepay all or part of his or her deposits at any time before he or she dies, retires, or discontinues City service, whichever may be sooner. In the event of extenuating circumstances that preclude an earlier payment, the Executive Director may allow a member up to ten days after his or her retirement or discontinuance of City service to make a lump sum payment of the balance.
    4. If a member dies, retires, or discontinues city service before completion of the contract, the member shall receive creditable service on his or her buy-in on a pro rata basis.
    5. The member is responsible for making any adjustments appropriate under the Internal Revenue Code with respect to individual retirement accounts and privately administered retirement plans.
6. City Matching Money. The City shall match the member's contributions and deposits, including interest, in the same manner as other members. If the worker provided services in two or more departments, at the request of the Director of Finance, the City Budget Director shall apportion the amount of the City contribution among the employing departments. The Director of Finance's determination of apportionment shall be final.

1. If not exercised, the opportunity described in this section for a worker to acquire ("buy in") service credit for prior City service in a temporary, interim, intermittent position or a part-time position of less than 20 hours per week over a one year period expires six calendar months after the worker becomes eligible for membership in the retirement system. Members who have otherwise failed to exercise an option to purchase creditable service for prior service previously rendered as a temporary worker, as that term is defined at Section 4.04.030, shall be allowed to purchase creditable service for service previously rendered but not credited as a temporary worker, by paying into the retirement fund, at the time of resignation from City service or at retirement, the actuarial present value of the resulting increase in his or her benefit. The terms and conditions of purchase shall be in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 4.36.567B.

### 4.36.580 - Creditable service for military service—purchase and allowance.

1. A member may purchase creditable service for past active duty in the armed forces of the United States of America or the State of Washington, by paying into the Retirement Fund, at the time of resignation from City service or at the time of retirement, the actuarial present value of the resulting increase in his or her benefit. Terms and conditions of purchase shall be in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 4.36.567. In no instance shall military service in excess of five (5) years be credited under this chapter.
2. Any member who shall make his normal contributions to the retirement system while on leave of absence under Section 1 of Ordinance 69816 or while absent in the active service of the United States Public Health Service in fulfillment of military service obligations under laws of the United States, or who after his return to City service shall make the same in full or in monthly payments equal to his current normal contribution, shall for the period of such leave of absence be entitled to all rights, privileges and benefits allowable under such system, including the allowance of such time as creditable service. In addition, any member in the City service on December 27, 1972, who heretofore or who hereafter enters the active military or naval service after having been laid off from City employment and who reentered or reenters City service subsequent to such active military or naval service shall be entitled to all rights, privileges and benefits allowable under such system, including the allowance of such period of military or naval service as creditable service provided that such member pay to the retirement system his normal contributions for such period.

### 4.36.585 - Use of other Plan funds for purchase of service credit

1. Direct Transfers. Effective January 1, 2002, the retirement fund possesses the specific authority to enter into direct transfer of assets agreements with the trustees of an eligible plan under Section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state, or from a plan under Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, for the purchase of creditable service otherwise available pursuant to SMC Chapter 4.36.
2. Other Rollovers. Effective January 1, 2002, the retirement fund may accept participant rollover contributions and/or direct rollovers of distributions from other retirement plans which are eligible retirement plans described in Internal Revenue Code Section 402(c)(8)(B) to the extent allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. The fund may accept rollovers from such sources and may develop such procedures and rules as it deems necessary or desirable to comply with the requirements and guide its decisions regarding participant rollover contributions and/or direct rollovers of distributions it will accept. Such rollover contributions and direct rollovers may be used for the purchase of service credit otherwise available pursuant to SMC Chapter 4.36.

### 4.36.590 - Election to participate in RCW Chapter 41.54

1. As authorized by RCW 41.54.061, the City irrevocably elects to participate in the portability of public retirement systems as contemplated by RCW Chapter 41.54, and to pay for the additional cost it may incur as a result of the benefits provided.
2. The eligibility of members for the portability of public retirements benefits, the benefits available thereunder, the limitations (including RCW 41.54.080), and the procedures shall be as set out in RCW Chapter 41.54. A member may aggregate service credit in two or more retirement systems for the purpose of determining the percentage factor to be used in calculating a service retirement allowance pursuant to subsection 4.36.605.B.
3. Beginning January 1, 2003, a dual member, as defined at RCW 41.54.010(4), who has failed to restore creditable service pursuant to RCW 41.54.020(2), or to redeposit during the period of December 1, 2001 through December 31, 2002 as provided in Section 9 of Ordinance 120684, may redeposit in the retirement fund an amount equal to that which he or she previously withdrew therefrom plus compound interest as determined by the Board. The terms and conditions of purchase shall be in accordance with the provisions of subsection 4.36.567.B.

### 4.36.595 - Beneficiaries—Domestic partners

An unmarried officer or employee may designate his or her domestic partner as his or her beneficiary for purposes of the benefits set forth in Sections 4.36.600, 4.36.605, 4.36.650, 4.36.610, 4.36.680 and 4.36.690 of this chapter upon the following terms and conditions.


1. The officer of employee shall file an affidavit of domestic partnership as described in Section 4.30.010 and 4.30.020 and file a copy of said affidavit with the Executive Director of the Retirement System. If the member is no longer an officer or employee of the City, he or she may designate his or her domestic partner by signing an affidavit as described in Section 4.30.020 and filing said affidavit with the Executive Director of the Retirement System.
2. A member who is married may not file an affidavit of domestic partnership. If a member has filed an affidavit of domestic partnership and is married, or thereafter becomes married, such affidavit shall be considered void. A member who has filed an affidavit of domestic partnership pursuant to this section shall immediately notify the Executive Director in writing if he or she has married and shall promptly file with the Executive Director a termination of the affidavit of domestic partnership. Termination of domestic partnership shall otherwise be as provided in Section 4.30.030 provided that the member shall also file a notice of termination of domestic partnership with the Executive Director.
3. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as granting to a domestic partner a property right to retirement benefits of a member. A member who has filed an affidavit of domestic partnership with the Executive Director does not need the consent of his or her domestic partner to take action with respect to his or her retirement benefits, including selection of a retirement option.
The Retirement Board is authorized to promulgate such rules as it deems necessary to implement this section.


### 4.36.600 - Retirement of a member for service by Board

Retirement of a member for service shall be made by the Board as follows:


1. Any member in the City service may retire by filing with the Board a written application, stating when he desires to be retired, such application to be made at least 30 days prior to date of retirement; provided, however, that the member, at the time specified for his retirement, shall have completed five years of City service as defined in this chapter, and shall have attained the age of 62 years, or shall have completed ten years of City service, and shall have attained the age of 57 years, or shall have completed 20 years of City service and shall have attained the age of 52 years, or shall have completed 30 years of City service as defined in this chapter. Permanent discontinuance of City service after the member has become eligible for a retirement allowance under the provisions of this chapter shall entitle such member to his retirement allowance: Provided that if discontinuance of City service is caused by intemperance, wilful misconduct or violation of law on the part of the member, of which the Board shall be the judge, the Board of Administration, in its discretion, may pay to the member, in one lump sum, his accumulated contributions, in lieu of a retirement allowance, and such payment shall constitute full satisfaction of all obligations of the City to such member, and upon receipt of such payment he shall cease to be a member of the system.
2. Any member of the retirement system who, upon termination of his employment with the City after at least five years' membership in the retirement system, elects to leave all his contributions in the retirement fund pursuant to Subsection 4.36.665 shall be eligible to receive a retirement allowance upon reaching the age of 62 years; provided, that if such member completed ten years of service prior to termination of his employment, he shall be eligible to receive a retirement allowance upon reaching the age of 57 years, and if such member completed 20 years of service prior to termination of his employment, he shall be eligible to receive a retirement allowance upon reaching the age of 52 years.

He shall thereupon be awarded a retirement allowance as provided for members in Section 4.36.605, and shall be eligible to elect in lieu thereof any of the options provided in Section 4.36.610; provided, that any person leaving the City service prior to qualifying for retirement under subsection A of this section shall not be eligible to receive any disability retirement allowance under Sections 4.36.650, 4.36.655 and 4.36.660, nor shall his estate or his beneficiaries receive the death benefit provided in Section 4.36.690; provided further, that persons leaving the City service prior to qualifying for retirement under subsection A of Section 4.36.600 shall, if and when eligible to receive a retirement allowance as provided in this subsection, be eligible for the alternative allowance computation provided in subsection B of Section 4.36.605, based upon his age at the time of commencement of payment of such member's retirement allowance, and in the event any such former employee dies before commencement of his retirement allowance pursuant to this subsection, the provisions of Subsection 4.36.680.C shall be applicable to such person's spouse or domestic partner, if named as beneficiary, and if there is no surviving spouse or domestic partner, the provisions of Subsection 4.36.680.C.2 shall be applicable to such person's child or children under the age of 18 years, if named as beneficiary.
3. Any former employee who prior to March 1, 1977, discontinued his City service to accept other public employment and who, because of such subsequent public employment, was permitted to leave his contributions in the retirement fund, shall be eligible to receive a retirement allowance upon reaching the age of 65 years; provided, that if such former employee completed five years of City service, he shall be eligible to receive a retirement allowance upon reaching the age of 62 years, and if such former employee completed ten years of City service, he shall be eligible to receive a retirement allowance upon reaching the age of 57 years; and if such former employee completed 20 years of City service, he shall be eligible to receive a retirement allowance upon reaching the age of 52 years.

He shall thereupon be awarded a retirement allowance as provided for members in Section 4.36.605, and shall be eligible to elect in lieu thereof any of the options provided in Section 4.36.610; provided, that any former employee to whom this subsection is applicable shall not be eligible to receive any disability retirement allowance under Sections 4.36.650, 4.36.655 and 4.36.660, nor shall his estate or his beneficiaries receive the death benefit provided in Section 4.36.690; provided further, that such former employees shall, if and when eligible to receive a retirement allowance as provided in this subsection, be eligible for the alternative allowance computation provided in subsection 4.36.605.B, based on his or her age at the time of commencement of payment of such member's retirement allowance, and, in the event any such person dies before commencement of his retirement allowance pursuant to this subsection, the provisions of subsection 4.36.680.B shall be applicable to such person's spouse or domestic partner, if named as beneficiary, and if there is no surviving spouse or domestic partner, the provisions of subsection 4.36.680.C shall be applicable to such person's child or children under the age of 18 years, if named as beneficiary.

### 4.36.605 - Retirement allowances designated

1. A member, upon retirement from service, shall receive a retirement allowance subject to the provisions of subsection B of this section, which shall consist of:

    1. An annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his accumulated contributions at the time of his retirement; and
    2. A pension purchased by the contributions of the City, equal to the annuity purchased by the accumulated normal contributions of the member.
2. The "percentage" scale in Table 4.36.605.B may be used in fixing the amount of a service retirement allowance, to be computed by multiplying the number of years of creditable service by the indicated percentage of final compensation; provided that such scale may also be used in determining benefits of surviving spouses and domestic partners of employees receiving disability retirement benefits under Subsection 4.36.650.D provided, further, that such scale may also be used in determining benefits payable under Subsection 4.36.680.C to the surviving spouse and domestic partner of any member who was at least 48 years of age at the time of such member's death. Use of this scale is subject to the limitation that the retirement allowance of a member shall not exceed 60 percent of the member's final compensation. The retirement allowance payable over and above the basic pension shall be purchased by contributions of the City. The application of the scale herein established shall be at the option of the member.

### 4.36.610 - Optional lesser retirement allowances and distribution of benefits upon death of a member who has been retired for service

Election of Optional Lesser Retirement Allowances. A member may elect to receive, in lieu of the retirement allowance provided for in Section 4.36.605, its actuarial equivalent in the form of a lesser retirement allowance, payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of one of the options set forth in Options A through E of this Section. Options F and/or G may be elected alone or in conjunction with one of the options set forth in Options A through E. The election of Option F or G will result in the actuarial equivalent of the retirement allowance otherwise payable. Option G includes the lump sum payment of a partial refund. If a combination is elected, the lesser retirement allowance shall be determined by first applying the Option G factor, if applicable, then the Option F factor, if applicable, and then finally the Option A — E factor.

Election of any option must be made by written application filed with the Board of Administration at least 30 days in advance of retirement as provided in Section 4.36.600, and shall not be effective unless approved by the Board prior to retirement of the member. The amount paid to a member, a beneficiary or a surviving spouse shall be reduced by payments made to an alternate payee under a court or department order as contemplated by Section 4.36.630.

Distribution of Benefits Upon Death of a Retired Member. Upon the death of a retired member, any death benefits will be payable in accordance with the provisions of the options elected under this section if any.

Options A through G.

OPTION A. The lesser retirement allowance shall be payable to the member throughout his life; provided, that if he dies before he receives in annuity payments pursuant to subsection 4.36.605.A.1 a total amount equal to the amount of his accumulated contributions as of the date of his retirement, the balance of such accumulated contributions shall be paid in one lump sum to his estate or to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board.

OPTION B. The lesser retirement allowance shall be payable to a member throughout his life provided that if he dies before he receives in annuity payments pursuant to subsection 4.36.605.A.1 a total amount equal to the amount of his accumulated contributions as of the date of his retirement, the annuity payments resulting from his accumulated contributions shall be continued and paid to his estate or to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board, until the total amount of annuity payment shall equal the amount of his accumulated contributions as it was at the date of his retirement.

OPTION C. The member shall elect a "guaranteed period" of any number of years. If he dies before the lesser retirement allowance has been paid to him for the number of years elected by him as the "guaranteed period," the lesser retirement allowance shall be continued to the end of the "guaranteed period," and during such continuation shall be paid to his estate or to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board.

OPTION D. The lesser retirement allowance shall be payable to the member throughout life, and after the death of the member, ½ of the lesser retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the individual who was the spouse or domestic partner of the member at the time of retirement. If the spouse or domestic partner predeceases the member, then upon receipt of written notice of such death by the Board, the member's retirement allowance shall increase to the amount that would have been provided as if the member had not selected this option.

OPTION E. The lesser retirement allowance shall be payable to the member throughout life, and after death of the member it shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the individual who was the spouse or domestic partner of the member at the time of retirement. If the spouse or domestic partner predeceases the member, then upon receipt of written notice of such death by the Board, the member's retirement allowance shall increase to the amount that would have been provided as if the member had not selected this option.

OPTION F. A member who retires from service prior to the age of becoming eligible for retirement payments under the federal system, commonly known as Social Security, and who at the time of retiring is fully insured under the federal system, may elect to have his retirement allowance payable during his or her life only, increased prior to the age at which the member could elect an unreduced Social Security retirement benefit and reduced after such age by amounts which have equivalent actuarial values. Prior to retirement, the member shall obtain, and provide to the Board, a written estimate of his Old-Age Benefit for the age at which the member could elect an unreduced Social Security benefit. If Option F is elected and the member's death occurs prior to the age at which the member could have elected an unreduced Social Security retirement benefit, any death benefit payable under any other option after the date the member would have attained such age, shall reflect the expected lesser amount of Option F.

OPTION G. The member may elect to receive a lump sum payment upon retirement, of either 50 percent or 100 percent of his or her accumulated contributions. The member's retirement allowance as provided for in Section 4.36.605 shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of the withdrawn lump sum.


### 4.36.615 - Annual cost of living adjustment

Pursuant to Ordinance 120685, effective January 1 of the year the Retirement Board files with the City Clerk notification that the funding ratio of the retirement fund is 100 percent or higher, subsection 4.36.215.B.2 shall read "Seventy percent of the indexed benefit."


1. Effective with the retirement allowance payable on or about December 1st of each year, a member's or beneficiary's adjusted benefit shall be increased by 1½ percent, except as otherwise provided in this section.
2. For any calendar year, the member or beneficiary shall receive the greater of:

    1. The adjusted benefit; or
    2. Sixty-five percent of the indexed benefit.

### 4.36.620 - Payments in monthly installments

A pension, annuity, or a retirement allowance granted under the provisions of this chapter, unless otherwise specified herein, shall be payable in monthly installments, and each installment shall be for the current calendar month.


### 4.36.625 - Benefits not subject to garnishment or attachment

The right of a person to a death benefit, pension, an annuity or a retirement allowance, to the return of contributions, the death benefit, pension, annuity or retirement allowance itself, any optional benefit, any other right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this chapter, and the moneys in the fund created under this chapter shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, or any other process whatsoever, and shall be unassignable except as in this chapter specifically provided.


### 4.36.630 - Qualified domestic relations orders—Orders of State Department of Social and Health Services to withhold and deliver

1. Authority. The Director may make payments to:

The term "order" as used in this section means either or both of the foregoing orders, and the term "alternate payee" means the recipient of payment on account of an order.


    1. A spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a member as directed in an order of the court that constitutes a qualified domestic relations order under 26 U.S.C. § 414 (p); and/or
    2. The Washington State Department of Social and Health Services as directed in an order to withhold and deliver under RCW 70.20A.080, each subject to the terms and conditions of this section, and to supplemental requirements that may be adopted by the Director by rule consistent with state and federal law to implement the ordinance codified in this section.
2. Limitations.

    1. Any payment to an alternate payee pursuant to an order shall reduce by a like amount the payment of benefits or withdrawal of contributions that would otherwise have been payable to or on account of the member without the order. Payment of an order shall first commence when benefits or a withdrawal of contributions is made to or on account of the member. The amount paid shall not exceed the benefits payable under this chapter and the retirement option selected by the member, or in the case of a withdrawal of accumulated contributions, the amount on deposit to the credit of the member.
    2. A payment to the alternate payee shall cease if the payment to a member would end on account of his or her death under a retirement option (Sections 4.36.605 through 4.36.610) or the member's reemployment (Sections 4.36.655 and 4.36.635) in the absence of the order. The Director may not, on account of such an order, limit or coerce the decision of an eligible member to accept a disability allowance (Sections 4.36.645 through 4.36.650) or, if on disability retirement, to return to City employment (Sections 4.36.655 and 4.36.660), or to convert to a service retirement allowance (Section 4.36.655); to withdraw accumulated contributions or to leave his or her contributions on deposit (Section 4.36.665), or to select a payment option (Sections 4.36.605 through 4.36.610).
3. Formula for Determination.

    1. If the member is already receiving benefits or has arranged to receive payment at a proximate date, the order must identify the alternate payee and the amount to be paid as:

        1. A precise sum to be paid in a single payment or in equal monthly installments and the duration of the installment payments; or
        2. A fixed percentage of the member's "disposable earnings" as defined in RCW 74.20A.090 or "disposable benefits" as defined in RCW 41.50.500(2), which are payable under the payment option that the member has selected.
    2. If the member is not yet receiving benefits or has not arranged to receive payment at a proximate date, the order may also determine the amount payable to an alternate payee by a formula or ratio that becomes complete upon the Director supplying the member's creditable or gross contributions; for example, a ratio that measures the member's creditable service on the date of the order to the member's creditable service at the time of retirement, or the member's contributions at a stated date, or a stipulated amount to the member's total contributions at the time benefits commence, or a withdrawal of accumulated contributions occurs. The City will not increase payments by an interest factor or adjust dollar values by a price index in calculating the payment to an alternate payee.
4. Rounding of Numbers. A percentage of disposable benefits or a ratio on a formula must be capable of being expressed as a decimal to no more than three places; fractions extending beyond the third decimal place will be rounded to the nearest number at the third decimal place and the amount of any warrant rounded to the nearest cent.
5. Filing of Orders for Future Use. The Director may keep orders on file until such time as the member makes a withdrawal of accumulated contributions or draws benefits. If such an order is on file as to a member, the Director may delay payment of benefits or of accumulated contributions for up to 30 days in order to determine whether or not the order is current and in effect.
6. Alternate Payee's Responsibility. An alternate payee has the responsibility of supplying and maintaining with the Director a current mailing address for making payments; if payments are to commence upon occurrence of an event, informing the Director when the event occurs; and in the event of an erroneous overpayment, returning to the City the warrant or check for issuance of another in the correct amount. Warrants or checks returned on account of an incorrect address may be held as unclaimed property.

### 4.36.635 - Retired members who are employed on salary

Annuity payments shall be paid to retired members who are in City service, but all pension payments shall be suspended while such retired members are employed on salary by the City, except as to the amount such pension payments may exceed the salary for the same period; provided, that such pension part of retirement allowances shall not be suspended as to any member who is temporarily employed in City service for periods not to exceed 1040 hours in any one year.


### 4.36.640 - Maximum benefits payable

1. The maximum benefits payable to any member shall not exceed the limitation for defined benefit plans for qualified pension trusts established by 26 U.S.C. § 415, a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix "A" and by this reference incorporated herein.
2. The Board of Administration shall determine this limitation, advise members on inquiry as to its amount, and include a general description of the limitations in its annual report to members.

### 4.36.645 - Retirement for disability

1. Any member may be retired for permanent and total disability, either ordinary or accidental, occurring while in City service upon examination as hereinafter set forth, if such employee meets either of the following requirements:

    1. The disability of such member arose out of and in the course of his employment as an employee of the City; or
    2. Such member had, at the time of occurrence of such disability, at least ten years of City service, over a period of not to exceed 15 years immediately preceding retirement, provided that City service lost while on previous disability retirement shall not be considered in determining if the applicant has City service in the limits specified.
2. Any member while in the City service, or within three months after the discontinuance of City service, or while physically or mentally incapacitated for the performance of duty, if such incapacity has been continuous from discontinuance of City service, shall be examined by a physician or surgeon, appointed by the Board of Administration, upon the application of the head of the office or department in which the member is employed, or upon application of the member, or a person acting in his behalf, stating that the member is permanently and totally incapacitated, either physically or mentally, for the performance of duty and ought to be retired. If such medical examination shows, to the satisfaction of the Board, that the member is permanently and totally incapacitated either physically or mentally for the performance of duty and ought to be retired, the Board shall retire the member for disability forthwith.
3. The Board shall secure such medical services and advice as it may deem necessary to carry out the purpose of this section and of Section 4.36.655, and shall pay for such medical services and advice such compensation as the Board shall deem reasonable.
4. The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to employees pensioned for permanent and total disability, as defined in and pursuant to state law.

### 4.36.650 - Disability allowances designated

For a member, making application for disability retirement after December 31, 2012, with less than 10 years of actual City service, but who otherwise qualifies for a disability retirement under the portability provisions of RCW 41.54.032, 1½ percent of final compensation multiplied by years of creditable City service. For all other members with at least 10 years of actual City service, 1½ percent of final compensation multiplied by years of creditable service, if such retirement allowance exceeds  of his final compensation; otherwise 1½ percent of final compensation multiplied by years of service which would be creditable to him were his services to continue until attainment of age 62 but such alternative disability retirement allowance shall not exceed  of such final compensation; provided, that no disability retirement allowance shall exceed 60 percent of final compensation. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the minimum retirement allowance shall be $140 per month.

The retirement allowance as above calculated shall consist of:


1. An annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated normal contributions;
2. A pension which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the City's matching contributions;
3. An additional pension, provided by contributions of the City, should the calculation of the allowance show that subsections 4.36.650.A.1, 2 and 3 above are not enough to produce the retirement allowance indicated;
4. When use of proper annuity and pension rates results in a retirement allowance amounting to more than would be realized by adherence to the formula indicated in the second paragraph of this section the Board shall allow the higher amount.

1. Upon retirement for disability, as provided in Section 4.36.645, provided the disability is not due to intemperance, willful misconduct or violation of law, of which the Board shall be the judge, a member shall receive a retirement allowance calculated as follows:
2. If disability is due to intemperance, willful misconduct, or violation of law, on the part of the member, the Board in its discretion, may pay to the member, in one lump sum his accumulated contributions in lieu of a retirement allowance; and such payment shall constitute full satisfaction of all obligations of the City to such member; and upon receipt of such payment he shall cease to be a member of the system.
3. For distribution of benefits paid upon the death of a member while in receipt of a disability retirement allowance, see subsection 4.36.680.B.
4. Any surviving spouse or domestic partner of a member receiving a disability retirement allowance may, if named as beneficiary, elect to receive and thereupon shall be paid in lieu of benefits under subsection 4.36.650.C a monthly benefit the equivalent of a survivor's "Option E" retirement allowance computed on the basis of the member's age at date of death, years of creditable service, and normal and matching contributions reduced by all sums theretofore paid the deceased member as annuity on normal contributions and pension on matching contributions, and, if applicable, by payments to an alternate payee under a court or department order as contemplated by Section 4.36.630. The spouse or domestic partner may elect to receive a cash payment of not to exceed ½ of the deceased member's remaining normal contributions, and such cash payment shall effect a reduction of the survivor's monthly benefit by the amount of annuity such payment would have purchased.

### 4.36.655 - Examination of disability beneficiary—Cancellation of allowance

1. The Board may require any disability beneficiary, under age 62 years, to undergo medical examination by a physician or surgeon, appointed by the Board at a place to be designated by the Board. Upon the basis of such examination the Board shall determine whether such disability beneficiary is still totally and permanently incapacitated, either physically or mentally, for City service. If the Board shall determine that the beneficiary is no longer so incapacitated, he shall be returned to City service at the earliest opportunity in accordance with civil service rules and regulations and upon such return his retirement allowance shall be cancelled.
2. Should a disability beneficiary reenter City service his retirement allowance shall be cancelled and he shall immediately become a member of the retirement system, his rate of contribution for future years being that established for his age at the time of such reentry. His individual account shall be credited with his accumulated normal contributions less the annuity payments made to him, except as provided in subsection 4.36.655.C. Such member shall receive credit for previous service in the same manner as if he had never been retired for disability.
3. Should any disability beneficiary under age 62 refuse to submit to medical examination, his pension may be suspended and should refusal continue for one year, his retirement allowance may be cancelled. Should any such disability beneficiary engage in a gainful occupation he shall immediately report his gross monthly income to the Board and upon receipt of such information the Board shall reduce the retirement allowance to an amount, which when added to the compensation earned by him in such occupation, shall not exceed the amount of the salary or wages presently attached to the regular position held by the disability beneficiary at the time of his retirement.

Should any such disability beneficiary fail to report his gainful occupation the Board shall, whenever information regarding such gainful occupation is received, cause his retirement allowance to be suspended either partially or in full, for the period of time necessary to make up for disability retirement allowance payments drawn by him during the time suspension should have been in effect and should such a beneficiary die before suspended disability retirement allowance payments have equaled payments illegally drawn, the Board shall recover such payments from any benefits which would otherwise be payable to his estate or to a designated beneficiary. Suspension of a disability retirement allowance under such circumstances may be made even after such a disability beneficiary has attained age 62. Should such disability beneficiary reenter City service the Board may reduce the accumulated contributions which would otherwise be credited to his account, as contemplated in subsection 4.36.655.B, to compensate for payments drawn during time suspension should have been in effect.

When any disability beneficiary reaches age 62 his retirement allowance shall be established at the amount which would normally be payable to him and shall not be modified for any cause except as provided in this chapter.

4. Should the retirement allowance of any disability beneficiary be cancelled for any cause other than reentrance into City service, he shall be paid his accumulated contributions, less annuity payments made to him.

If, in the judgment of the Board, a disability beneficiary has failed to properly report his earnings from gainful occupation, the Board may cancel his disability retirement allowance.

5. Should any disability beneficiary who was eligible to receive a service retirement allowance at the time he was retired for disability, desire to convert his disability retirement allowance into the service retirement allowance he was eligible to at time of retirement on disability, the Board may grant his petition so to do.

### 4.36.660 - Temporary total disability

1. Any member who has not attained the age of 65 and who has at least ten years of City service over a period of not to exceed 15 years may, upon his application therefor, be retired by the Board for temporary total disability occurring while in City service. Such temporary total disability shall include only a physical or mental incapacity which the Board finds and determines temporarily and totally incapacitates such member for City service.
2. Temporary total disability retirement allowances shall be computed and paid until such disability has ceased, in the same manner and amounts as for permanent and total disability, and shall commence immediately after termination of all payments to the member on account of sick leave, vacation, accumulated time, industrial insurance benefits, and disability payments under Charter Article XVI, Section 24, or any other such benefits.
3. Upon determining that any such temporary total disability has ceased, the Board shall terminate the temporary total disability retirement, and the retirement allowance therefor shall be cancelled; or if a member is otherwise eligible, the Board shall convert such temporary total disability retirement to a permanent total disability retirement or a service retirement.
4. In determining eligibility for temporary total disability retirement and termination thereof, the Board may secure such medical assistance as it deems necessary. The Board shall have the authority to require a medical re-examination of a member retired for temporary total disability at least once every 24 months following the effective date of the temporary total disability retirement until such time as the member has attained regular service retirement age, and at any time if there is reason to believe the temporary total disability has ceased.
5. Upon termination of any temporary total disability retirement, a member who returns to active City service shall be reinstated as a nonretired member of the retirement system and his accumulated contributions less annuity payments shall be credited to his account and he shall contribute at the rate applicable to him at the time he was retired. Any member who does not return to City service after termination of temporary total disability retirement shall be entitled to his accumulated contributions less any annuity payments made to him.
6. Periods during which a member is retired for temporary total disability shall not be recognized as creditable service on any subsequent retirement.

### 4.36.665 - Discontinuance of eligible employee

1. Should the City service of a member not eligible for retirement under the provisions of this chapter, be discontinued, except by death, prior to completion of five years' membership in the retirement system, he shall be paid six months after the date of discontinuance such part of his accumulated contributions as he shall demand; provided, however, that such member may apply to the Board and by unanimous vote the Board may grant a request for immediate withdrawal of contributions. If in the opinion of the Board such member is permanently separated from City service by reason of such discontinuance, he shall be paid forthwith all his accumulated contributions, with interest. Should the City service of an employee not eligible for retirement under subsections A and B of Section 4.36.600 who has been a member of the retirement system for at least five years be discontinued, except by death, he may apply for immediate withdrawal of his accumulated contributions as hereinabove provided, or elect in writing within six months after such termination to leave his accumulated contributions in the retirement fund, and thereafter, upon reaching the required age and making application therefor, he shall receive a retirement allowance as provided in Section 4.36.600 C; provided, that if discontinuance of City service is caused by intemperance, wilful misconduct or violation of law on the part of the member, of which the Board shall be the judge, the Board, in its discretion, may pay to the member, in one lump sum, his accumulated contributions, in lieu of all other rights, privileges or benefits under this chapter; and such payment shall constitute full satisfaction of all obligations of the City to such member, and upon receipt of such payment he shall cease to be a member of the system.
2. Any member eligible for retirement under subsections 4.36.600.A and B whose City service has been discontinued, except by death, and any member whose City service has been discontinued and who has elected to leave his accumulated contributions in the retirement fund, may, in the manner hereinabove provided, apply to the Board for withdrawal of contributions, but in such case the Board may, in its discretion, approve such request or disapprove the same and, if such member then be eligible, authorize his retirement. Upon withdrawal of contributions the full amount deposited by the City in the retirement fund for such member's benefit, plus interest, shall be available to meet the obligations of the City under this chapter.

### 4.36.670 - Election to rollover to an eligible retirement plan

1. This section applies notwithstanding any contrary provision that would otherwise limit a distributee's ability to make a rollover election. A distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed under this chapter, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
2. The following definitions apply to this Section:

    1. "Direct rollover" means a payment under this chapter to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.
    2. "Distributee" means an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.

    4. "Eligible rollover distribution" means any distribution of all or any portion of the member's benefits under this chapter, except: (a) any distribution which is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the member or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the member and the member's Designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; (b) any distribution to the extent required under Code § 401(a)(9); (c) the portion of any distribution which is not includible in gross income; (d) any hardship distribution; (e) a corrective distribution; (f) a deemed distribution resulting from a defaulted member loan which is not also an offset distribution; (g) any other distributions described in Treas.

For distributions made after December 31, 2006, a non-spouse designated beneficiary (including a trust which qualifies as a designated beneficiary), may, by direct rollover, roll over an eligible rollover distribution to an eligible retirement plan; provided that for this purpose, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement plan that the non-spouse designated beneficiary establishes for purposes of receiving the distribution and which is treated as an inherited IRA under Code § 408(d)(3)(C). If a non-Spouse Designated Beneficiary receives a distribution from the Plan, the distribution is not eligible for a 60-day rollover.
    7. Certain Requirements Not Applicable Before 2010. Although a non-Spouse Designated Beneficiary may roll over directly a distribution as provided in this section, any distribution made prior to January 1, 2010, is not subject to the Direct Rollover requirements of Code § 401(a)(31) (including Code § 401(a)(31)(B)), the notice requirements of Code § 402(f) or the mandatory withholding requirements of Code § 3405(c)).
    8. Effective January 1, 2006, in the event of a mandatory lump sum distribution in an amount greater than $1,000, if the participant does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the participant in a direct rollover or to receive the distribution directly, then such distribution shall be paid in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the Board.

### 4.36.675 - Discontinuance of membership of terminally ill member

1. Authority. The Board of Administration may in its discretion authorize an employee to discontinue his or her membership in the City Employee's Retirement System and it may refund all contribution that the employee has made, together with interest thereon, if the employee makes written application therefor and all the conditions in subsection B of this section are met.

    2. The member's acknowledgment that by discontinuing his or her membership in the system, he or she will become ineligible for all retirement benefits under the system; for death benefits under Sections 4.36.690—4.36.695; and for reentry into the system under Section 4.36.567 for one year, and then may reenter only with consent of the Board; that, if the member has a spouse or domestic partner, discontinuing membership will render his or her spouse or domestic partner ineligible for spousal or domestic partner benefits upon a member's death or disability; and that refund of his or her contributions may result in withholdings, taxes, and penalties under the Internal Revenue Code; and
    3. If the member is married, a signed written consent of the member's spouse to his or her discontinuance of membership and withdrawal of contributions, including an acknowledgment that discontinuing the employee's membership may forgo spousal benefits in event of the employee's death.

The Board may require an applicant to undergo a physical examination by a physician selected by the Board and/or require the applicant to permit verification of his or her medical condition by allowing an examination of the applicant's medical records or an interview with his or her doctor or caregiver.
4. Reentry/Redeposit. After the lapse of one year, the Board of Administration may in its discretion allow a member who has discontinued membership and recovers from his or her terminal illness to reenter the City Employee's Retirement System. If the member's application is granted, the member shall accrue service credit from the date of his or her reentry into the system, provided, that if the member's application for reentry occurs within three years after the date of the member's discontinuance of his or her membership, the Board may allow the member to make redeposit into the retirement fund of his or her withdrawn contributions plus interest in the manner contemplated by Section 4.36.567, and, upon completing all such payments, thereby acquire creditable service for the earlier period.
5. Discretionary Determination. This section confers enabling authority on the Board to be exercised in extraordinary circumstances and it imposes no duty upon the Board to grant any particular application. The Board's decision upon an application shall be final.

### 4.36.680 - Distribution of benefits upon death of a member

Upon the death of any member who has not been retired or who has been retired for disability, such member's accumulated contributions less any payments therefrom already made to such member shall be paid to such member's surviving spouse or domestic partner, or if the deceased member does not have a surviving spouse or domestic partner, or if the surviving spouse prior to the death of such member consented in writing to the naming as hereafter provided of a different beneficiary or beneficiaries and waived in writing all rights to benefits under subsection 4.36.680.C, then to such member's estate, or to such person or persons as such member shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board. Such payment may be made in one lump sum or may be paid in installments over a period of not to exceed five years, as may be designated by the member or his beneficiary, with such rate of interest as may be determined by the Board.


1. Distribution of benefits upon the death of a member who has been retired for service. See Section 4.36.610.
2. Distribution of benefits upon the death of a member who has not been retired or who has been retired for disability. The terms of this subsection apply upon the death of a member who has been retired for disability with the exception of the requirement that such member's surviving spouse waive in writing all rights to benefits under Subsection 4.36.680.C.
3. Distribution of benefits upon the death of a member who has not been retired.

    1. Any surviving spouse or domestic partner, of a member not retired but having at the date of death at least ten years of creditable service as defined in this chapter, who is entitled to receive such deceased member's accumulated contributions as provided in subsection 4.36.680.B, may elect to receive and thereupon shall be paid in lieu of benefits under subsection 4.36.680.B, a benefit the equivalent of a survivor's "Option E" retirement allowance. The spouse or domestic partner may, however, elect to receive in lieu of either the above retirement allowance or the benefits under subsection 4.36.680.B, a lesser retirement allowance to cease at such spouse's or domestic partner's death and in addition a cash payment not to exceed ½ of the deceased member's accumulated normal contributions. However, such withdrawal shall not serve to reduce such lesser retirement allowance except by the amount of annuity which such withdrawal would have purchased.
    2. If there is no surviving spouse or domestic partner at the time of death of a member not retired, but having at least ten years of creditable service as defined in this chapter, and such member has surviving one or more children under the age of 18 years, and if such child or children are named as beneficiary or if the contributions of the deceased member are payable to such member's estate under the provisions of subsection 4.36.270.B [4.36.680.B], then the legal guardian of such child or children may elect for such child or children a monthly benefit as hereinafter provided, which monthly benefit shall be paid in lieu of the benefits payable under subsection 4.36.680.B. Such monthly benefits shall be equal to the monthly benefit which would have been paid to the last spouse of such deceased member if such last spouse had been living and married to the deceased member at the time of his death and was otherwise eligible for and elected to receive the benefits provided in subsection 4.36.680.C equivalent to a survivor's "Option B" retirement allowance without a cash payment of a portion of the deceased member's accumulated normal contributions. The guardian may, however, elect to receive in lieu of either the above benefits or the benefits under subsection 4.36.680.B, a lesser retirement allowance which will continue until such child or children reach the age of 18 years and in addition a cash payment not to exceed ½ of the deceased member's accumulated normal contributions. However, such withdrawal shall not serve to reduce such lesser allowance except by the amount of annuity which such withdrawal would have purchased. All benefits payable under this subsection shall be paid to the legal guardian of such child or children under the age of 18 years until all of such children have reached the age of 18 years, and shall be for the benefit of such minor children.
    3. The amount paid to a member's estate, beneficiary or surviving spouse or domestic partner may be reduced by payments made to an alternate payee under a court or department order as contemplated by Section 4.36.630.
    4. If the member's estate is not being probated, the Board, in its discretion, may as an alternative to making payment to his or her estate, authorize payment to an heir who would inherit if the estate were probated, such as a surviving spouse named under a community property agreement or in the member's will.

### 4.36.690 - Death benefits—Payment

1. Upon proof of the death of a member of the retirement system who has paid all death benefit assessments as hereinafter provided, the sum of $2,000 as a death benefit shall be paid to such member's surviving spouse or domestic partner or if such deceased member does not have a surviving spouse or domestic partner, or if the surviving spouse prior to the death of such member consented in writing to the naming as hereinafter provided of a different beneficiary or beneficiaries, then to such member's estate or to such person or persons as such member shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board. If the member's estate is not being probated, the Board, in its discretion, may as an alternative to making payment to his or her estate, authorize payment to an heir who would inherit if the estate were probated, such as a surviving spouse named under a community property agreement or in the member's will.
2. Any member of the retirement system may elect to continue in the death benefit system and pay the death benefit assessments: provided, that such payment shall not be required of a member retiring for disability until age 60, whereupon such member shall be required to pay all death benefit assessments thereafter accruing if he or she desires to continue in the death benefit system. Upon proof of the death of such member, the payment shall be $2,000.

### 4.36.695 - Death benefits—Specifications

1. All moneys paid into or out of the retirement fund on account of the death benefit system shall be accounted for by double entry separately in the records of the retirement system in such a manner as to reveal currently the amount of money held for payment of death benefits.
2. Death benefit assessments shall become due and payable January 1st of each year and collectible by payroll deduction or otherwise as directed by the Board. In order to insure coverage of members laid off or on leave of absence or on family or medical leave under Chapter 4.26, the Board is authorized to transfer amounts necessary to pay assessments due from such members from their normal contributions as temporary loans to be repaid by such members on return to City service. Death benefit assessments shall be in such amount as shall be determined by the Board but shall not exceed the sum of $12 in any calendar year.
3. An employee becoming a member of the system during the year shall pay the death benefit assessment fixed for that year if such membership is effective prior to October 1st, which assessment shall be collectible by payroll deduction when the first normal contribution is made. Employees becoming members in October, November and December shall pay only ½ of that annual assessment.
4. The City shall match all death benefit assessments collected from members and such matching payments shall become due and payable immediately following determination of the amount necessary, and should the death benefit system require payments by the City of more than the amount necessary to match an assessment of not to exceed $12, as determined by the Board on advice of its actuary, the same may be made from undivided earnings of the City and the employee in the retirement fund not otherwise obligated. All payments by the City shall be due and payable annually on January 1st. Assessments collected from retired members shall be matched by funds from departments from which such members retired.
5. Membership in the death benefit system shall terminate when any member resigns, quits or is discharged and no refund of any portion of death benefit assessments shall be made by reason thereof. Should the Board determine that a member of the retirement system not in City service was maintaining membership for the sole purpose of possibly receiving retirement benefits in the future, the Board shall deny participation in the death benefit system to such member.
6. The Board of Administration shall make all rules and regulations necessary to supplement the death benefit provisions of this chapter.

### 4.36.700 - Appropriation for administration of retirement system

The City Council shall appropriate annually from the retirement fund the amount it deems necessary for the purpose of paying the expenses of administering the retirement system. The Board of Administration shall annually submit to the City Council its estimate of the amount necessary to pay such expenses.


### 4.36.705 - Trust fund

1. The retirement fund shall be a trust fund for the exclusive benefit of the members of the City Employees' Retirement System and their beneficiaries. No part of the corpus or income of the retirement fund shall be used for or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the members of the system or their beneficiaries and the payment of fees and expenses of maintaining and administering the system.
2. This section shall be interpreted to allow the following:

    1. A return of a contribution to the City or its application as a credit on future contributions, after the Board determines that the City has paid or overpaid the contribution under a mistake of fact;
    2. The making of refunds required by law; and
    3. Termination of the retirement system and distribution of its assets after all liabilities with respect to the members of the retirement system and their beneficiaries have been satisfied.

### 4.36.710 - Status of benefits in event of termination of system

If the City terminates or partially terminates the retirement system, members shall have a nonforfeitable right to benefits accrued prior to the date of such termination or partial terminations to the extent funded as of that date, or the amounts credited to the employees' accounts. As used in this section, "terminate" means to discontinue the system completely without a comparable replacement plan; "partially terminate" means to exclude a segment of employees from coverage without the provision of a comparable replacement; and "nonforfeitable" means that a member's or beneficiary's right to an immediate or deferred benefit that arises from the member's City service is unconditional and legally enforceable against the retirement system to the extent then accrued, except that rights to a benefit based upon the City's contribution and completion of a minimum term of City service may be lost by death of the member before the term has expired.


### 4.36.715 - Compliance with Internal Revenue Code

If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code § 401(a)(9) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.


1. In General. This chapter shall be administered in a manner to comply with the applicable requirements of 26 U.S.C. Section 401(a), and the Board is authorized to promulgate rules as it deems necessary to effectuate such compliance.
2. Compliance with Code § 401(a)(2) - Exclusive Benefit. See Section 4.36.705.
3. Compliance with Code § 401(a)(9) - Required Minimum Distributions

    1. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of this chapter.
    2. All benefits and distributions required under this section will be determined and paid in accordance with a reasonable and good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code § 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Code § 414(d).
    3. Distributions to a member and his or her beneficiaries under this section shall only be made in accordance with the incidental death benefit requirements of IRC § 401(a)(9)(G) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
    4. The Board will begin distributions of a member's retirement benefits under this chapter no later than the member's "required beginning date." A member's "required beginning date" is the later of the April 1st following the close of the calendar year in which the member leaves City employment or, the April 1st following the close of the calendar year in which the member attains the age of 70½.
    5. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's retirement benefits must begin to be distributed, no later than as follows:

        1. If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70½, if later.
        2. If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died.
        3. If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death.
        4. If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subparagraph (rather than subparagraph 4.36.715.C.5.i above) will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. For purposes of this subsection, unless this subparagraph applies, distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date. If this subparagraph applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subparagraph 4.36.715.C.5.i above. If distributions under an annuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse, the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.
4. Compliance with Code § 401(a)(17) - Compensation Limit. The compensation limit is addressed under the definition of "Compensation" in Section 4.36.040.
5. Compliance with Code § 401(a)(31) - Eligible Rollover Distributions. See Section 4.36.670.
6. Compliance with Code § 414(p) - Qualified Domestic Relations Orders (QDRO). The treatment of QDROs under this chapter is described under Section 4.36.630.
7. Compliance with Code § 415. See subsection 4.36.640.A.
8. Compliance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) and the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008 (HEART)

    1. HEART Act Death Benefits. In the case of a death occurring on or after January 1, 2007, if a member dies while performing qualified military service (as defined in Code § 414(u)(5), the member's beneficiary is entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) provided under this chapter as if the member had resumed employment and then terminated employment on account of death. Moreover, the member's qualified military service will count as service for vesting purposes, as though the member had resumed employment under USERRA immediately prior to the member's death.
    2. Effective January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Code §§ 414(u)(12) and 3401(h), any member receiving a differential wage payment (as defined under Code § 3401(h)(2)) from an employer will be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment will be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Code § 415(c). This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner.

### 4.36.720 - Administration of chapter—Construction—Severability

1. The retirement plan created by this chapter shall be administered so as to comply with the federal Internal Revenue Code, Title 26 U.S.C., where applicable, and specifically with plan qualification requirements imposed on governmental plans by Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
2. Any section or provision of this chapter which may be susceptible to more than one construction shall be interpreted in favor of the construction most likely to satisfy requirements imposed on governmental plans by Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
3. If any section or provision of this chapter is found to be in conflict with the plan qualification requirements for governmental plans in Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the conflicting part of this chapter is hereby inoperative solely to the extent of the conflict, and such finding shall not affect the operation of the remainder of this chapter.

### 4.36.900 - Outdated provisions

The following provisions no longer apply to current or possible future members of the system, or involve benefits already conferred on existing members. These provisions remain in effect only to the extent necessary to determine already conferred benefits and for purposes of compliance with requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. None of these provisions is effective with respect to current or future members of the retirement system as of the effective date of this Ordinance, introduced as Council Bill 118199.

The increases provided herein shall be paid from available retirement system funds or from contributions of the City. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the amount of any bonus dividend declared pursuant to Section 4.36.155, nor shall any such bonus dividend be considered as a part of monthly benefits for the purpose of computing the percentage increases authorized in this subsection.

"One year window for purchase of creditable service for initial six months of City service for employees hired during 1988 through 1998 period


Current City Employees

(current hourly rate) × (current member contribution rate) × (amount of hours to be purchased).

Former City Employees

(final hourly rate as determined by the Board and adjusted for inflation) × (contribution rate in effect for new members as of effective date of Section 4.36.570) × (amount of hours to be purchased).


1. During a window period of one (1) year, beginning on the effective date of this section, employees who were hired during the period 1988 through 1998 who have not purchased creditable service for the initial six (6) months of City employment may purchase said creditable service by paying the purchase price, as determined by the Board, into the retirement fund, or signing a creditable service purchase contract pursuant to Subsection 4.36.567 C and filing it with the Retirement Board. The creditable service may be purchased based on the following price formula:
2. Purchases by former city employees made pursuant to Subsection 4.36.900 F.1 must be paid in full by lump sum payment by the end of the window period established in said subsection or the date of retirement, whichever occurs first.
3. City Matching Contributions under Subsection 4.36.900 F.1. As matching contributions pursuant to Subsection 4.36.540 A, each year the employing department shall pay into the retirement fund the matching amount equivalent to any member lump sum payment made pursuant to this section or, if a member purchased pursuant to a contract under Subsection 4.36.567 C, the member's current year buy back payments all as billed by the Retirement office."

(hourly rate) × (current member contribution rate (8.03% × (amount of hours to be purchased) × (interest factor as calculated below).

Creditable service shall be based on the employee's or officer's actual hours and salary in the period of time going back no more that 10 years from the effective date of this ordinance. The interest factor applied to the purchase price will be determined by approximating the net investment returns of the retirement fund that occurred during the period of time that relates to the buyback, with a minimum interest factor no less than the actuarially assumed rate of investment return for the same periods. The purchase price shall be calculated using an annualized interest rate, compounded bi-weekly. Notwithstanding the above purchase price interest factor, the amount credited to the individual member accounts will be calculated by applying an interest rate 5.75% to approximate what the creditable amount would have been had the individual been a contributing member of the retirement system all along. Only the amount credited to the individual member accounts will be included in any benefit calculation or any future withdrawal.


1. An officer or employee of the Seattle Firefighter's Pension Fund who was hired as an employee or officer thereof on or before the effective date of this Ordinance and who thereafter becomes and continues his or her service as an employee of the City may elect to join the City's retirement system and contract to purchase credit for prior service performed for the Seattle Firefighter's Pension Board by completing and filing an election form with the Board, and paying the purchase price, as determined by the Board, into the retirement fund on or before thirty days after the effective date of this ordinance. The creditable service may be purchased based on the following price formula:
2. An officer or employee subject to this section who fails to exercise his or her option under this subsection on or before thirty days after the effective date of this ordinance, may not thereafter purchase such credit provided, however, that nothing in this section shall affect such an officer or employee's right to elect to join the retirement system or to purchase creditable service earned subsequent to the effective date of this ordinance or at any time thereafter in the manner provided under Section 4.36.525 E of the Seattle Municipal Code.

Nothing in this subsection shall affect the amount of any bonus dividend declared pursuant to Section 4.36.900 E.

## Chapter 4.38 - DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

Sections:

### 4.38.010 - City of Seattle voluntary deferred compensation plan.

The City of Seattle hereby adopts the deferred compensation plan and trust for City employees as stated in The City of Seattle Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan and Trust ("Plan and Trust Document"), which shall be filed with the City Clerk. The administration and investment of employee deferrals shall be governed by the provisions of the Plan and Trust Document.



## Chapter 4.40 - CITY UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM

Sections:

### 4.40.010 - Unemployment insurance program—Generally.

1. A program of unemployment insurance is established for eligible employees of the City, including all such eligible employees of the Seattle Public Library upon adoption by the Board of Trustees of the Seattle Public Library of a resolution providing therefor. Employees whose service and pay are interrupted by layoff for lack of work or funds after November 1, 1974, including temporary employees who have completed a stipulated period of employment, and who were employed full time by the City continuously for a period of one (1) year immediately preceding such layoff, and who are not excluded by Section 4.40.030, and who provide evidence that they are available for and actively seeking employment, shall be entitled to receive unemployment compensation benefits for a maximum benefit period of twenty-six (26) weeks in an amount not less than Seventeen Dollars ($17) per week nor more than fifty (50) percent of the statewide average weekly wage as determined annually by the Washington State Department of Employment Security, under the conditions established in and as more fully described in C.F. 280329. An employee who has been on leave of absence during the year immediately prior to layoff shall be deemed in continuous employment immediately preceding such layoff for purposes of eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits as provided herein, but such leave time when taken without pay shall not be included in the computation of the one (1) year requirement.
2. The Seattle Human Resources Director is authorized and directed to administer the unemployment insurance program, and in such connection may promulgate administrative regulations from time to time in the manner provided in the Administrative Code (Ordinance 102228) to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter. The Director is further authorized to contract for necessary consulting services, for reinsurance, and for such other services as may be necessary from time to time to administer the unemployment insurance program.
3. Beginning January 1, 1978, the Seattle Human Resources Director shall administer an unemployment insurance claims management system. The Director shall have the authority to employ such persons, in accordance with civil service laws and rules, make such expenditures, require such reports, make such investigations and to take such other action as he deems necessary or suitable in limiting the City's unemployment compensation liability and in operating a claims management system. The Director shall also coordinate and manage all recordkeeping and reporting functions required under the State Employment Tax Act and the Director is designated as the liaison for unemployment insurance purposes between the City, state and/or federal officials and agencies. All department heads are directed to cooperate with and aid the Seattle Human Resources Director in the operation of a successful claims management system.
4. Beginning January 1, 1978, the program of unemployment insurance shall be continued for all eligible employees of the City by virtue of the mandates and pursuant to the provisions of the State Employment Security Act (RCW Chapter 50). This subsection has been enacted to comply with the provisions of RCW Chapter 50, which mandate unemployment insurance coverage for political subdivisions. This subsection shall remain in effect only for so long as such mandatory coverage provisions of RCW Chapter 50 remain effective.
5. In the event the mandatory coverage ceases to be effective, then the section or subsections of this amendatory chapter, to the extent that they apply to unemployment insurance coverage of City employees under the State Employment Security Act (RCW Chapter 50), shall be deemed nullified and the language of the sections being amended shall be reinstated.
6. Represented employees, where the City has agreed so under current effective bargaining agreements, shall be assured of a weekly benefit amount under the state's program which is equivalent to the weekly benefit amount provided under subsection A of this section.
7. No employee of the City shall be entitled to collect City unemployment compensation benefits while drawing unemployment compensation benefits from another source. The intent of this subsection is to prevent an employee from collecting more than the maximum weekly benefit amount, regardless of the source, assured under subsections B and D of this section for the same base year wages.

### 4.40.020 - Unemployment Insurance Subfund established

There is established in the City Treasury, as a special subfund of the General Fund, an "Unemployment Insurance Subfund." The unemployment insurance program established by this chapter shall be funded by appropriate billings from the Seattle Human Resources Director to all departments with eligible employees and such other revenues as may be authorized by ordinance.

From this subfund shall be paid all costs and expenses, including administrative costs, arising from the unemployment insurance program and such other expenditures as may be authorized by ordinance.


### 4.40.030 - Excluded employees.

The following City employees are excluded from the City unemployment insurance program and shall not be entitled to benefits under the program, provided that beginning January 1, 1978 this section shall only apply according to the provisions of subsections D and E of Section 4.40.010:


1. Employees represented by the Police Officers Guild;
2. Employees represented by the International Association of Fire Fighters, Local No. 27;
3. Employees of the City who are employed under personal service contracts;
4. Employees whose salaries are funded by state or federal grants, except:

    1. Where employees are included in the program by collective bargaining agreements with the City, or
    2. Where the agency making the grant agrees to fund the costs incurred by participation in the program, or
    3. Where the conditions of the grant provide that employees funded by the grant must be afforded benefits to the same extent as other employees.

### 4.40.040 - Repayment of benefits to which one is not entitled.

Anyone receiving a payment from the City pursuant to this chapter to which he or she is not entitled shall promptly repay the same to the Director of Finance and Administrative Services.


### 4.40.050 - Violation—Penalty.

1. Anyone who knowingly makes any false statement or representation with intent to secure benefits to which he or she is not entitled under this chapter, and anyone who retains any payments made pursuant to this chapter knowing that he or she is not entitled to retain the same, shall be guilty of a violation of this chapter, and upon conviction thereof may be punished by a civil fine or forfeiture not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500), but a conviction of a violation shall not give rise to any disability or legal disadvantage based on the conviction of a criminal offense.
2. Notwithstanding the civil nature of the penalty provided herein, nothing in this section shall deny any constitutional rights which a defendant would have were the penalty deemed criminal.


## Chapter 4.44 - DISABILITY COMPENSATION

Sections:

### 4.44.010 - Deductions from employee's earnings.

The Director of Finance and Administrative Services is authorized and directed to deduct and pay from the earnings of any City employee, in accordance with RCW 41.04.030 and pursuant to written authorization therefor signed by such employee and filed with the Director of Finance and Administrative Services in accordance with RCW 41.04.020, such amounts for disability insurance premiums, other than retroactive premiums, to such insurance groups or companies as shall be specifically designated therein; provided, that no deduction or payment shall be made unless:


1. Such insurance group or company shall provide authorization forms without expense to the City, which authorizations shall save the City harmless from any liability in connection with the making or failure to make any deduction or payment, and shall further specifically recognize that the City does not endorse the insurance group or company to which such payment is made and that such deduction and payment does not constitute sponsorship of the program; and
2. As to insurance groups or companies providing such insurance on an individual basis or on a group basis for groups of less than 25 individuals, such insurance group or company, for reimbursement to the City of its costs in connection with such deductions and payment, shall pay to the City upon quarterly billings by the Director of Finance and Administrative Services, $.10 for each payroll deduction for each employee who has authorized as provided herein deduction and payment of disability insurance premiums to such insurance group or company.

### 4.44.020 - City compensation additional to State Industrial Insurance and Medical Aid.

1. Any City officer or employee otherwise entitled to sick leave and vacation benefits and for whom State Industrial Insurance and Medical Aid is provided, including temporary workers who qualify for sick leave and vacation pursuant to subsection 4.20.055.B, who shall be disabled in the discharge of his or her duties, and whose disablement results in absence from his or her regular duties, shall receive compensation, except as otherwise hereinafter provided, from the City in the amount his or her normal pay exceeds any state disability compensation to equal 80 percent of the employee's normal hourly rate of pay, not to exceed 261 regularly scheduled workdays counted from the first regularly scheduled workday on or after the fourth calendar day following the injury; provided, the disability sustained must qualify the employee for benefits under State Industrial Insurance and Medical Aid Acts. Such compensation shall be authorized by the Seattle Human Resources Director, or his or her designee, with the advice of such employee's department head, on request from the employee supported by satisfactory evidence of medical treatment of the illness or injury giving rise to such employee's claim for compensation under this chapter. Such employee shall continue to receive compensation at the rate provided for herein until such employee returns to full-time active duty or such employee exhausts his or her benefits hereunder, whichever occurs first.
2. Whenever an employee is injured on the job and compelled to seek immediate medical treatment, the employee shall be compensated in full for the remaining part of the day of injury without effect to his or her sick leave or vacation account. Scheduled workdays falling within only the first three (3) calendar days following the day of injury shall be compensable through accrued sick leave. Any earned vacation may be used in a like manner after sick leave is exhausted, provided that, if neither accrued sick leave nor accrued vacation is available, the employee shall be placed on no pay status for these three (3) days; provided, further, that this shall constitute the only authorized use of sick leave or vacation by an employee whose disability claim is subsequently approved. If the period of disability equals or extends beyond fourteen (14) calendar days, then (1) any accrued sick leave or vacation leave utilized that results in absence from his or her regular duties (up to a maximum of eighty (80) percent of the employee's normal hourly rate of pay per day) shall be reinstated by Workers Compensation; or (2) if no sick leave or vacation leave was available to the employee at that time, then the employee shall thereafter be compensated for the three (3) calendar days at the eighty (80) percent compensation rate described in subsection A of this section. The days reimbursed or thereafter compensated shall then count toward the two hundred sixty-one (261) day maximum.
3. An employee's department head may recommend to the Seattle Human Resources Director denial of the employee's claim for benefits under the State Industrial Insurance and Medical Aid Acts and under this chapter, and the Seattle Human Resources Director shall evaluate such recommendation and, if the Director concurs in such recommendation, request denial by the State Department of Labor and Industries of the employee's claim under said state acts. If the Seattle Human Resources Director requests such denial, the employee shall be continued on the payroll of his or her department receiving continuous pay at a rate to be determined by the Seattle Human Resources Director pursuant to applicable state law and City ordinances, until the State Department of Labor and Industries has reviewed and denied such claim.

### 4.44.030 - Compensation for holidays and earned vacation.

In the event of any conflict between this chapter and the provisions of any such policy of insurance, the policy provision shall be controlling; provided, however, that nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to limit or restrict any employee's or official's rights to full coverage pursuant to this chapter, it being the intention of this section to provide complete coverage outside and beyond insurance policies which may be in effect while not compromising the terms and conditions of such policies by any conflicting provision contained in this chapter.
3.

4. Nothing in Section 4.64.010 shall preclude the City from undertaking an officer or employee's defense under a reservation of rights.

### 4.64.016 - Administrative proceedings.

Any City employee or officer shall make their request for defense to the Chief of the Civil Division of the Law Department. Thereafter, the Chief of the Civil Division of the Law Department shall, after receiving a report and recommendation regarding the request from the relevant department head, make a determination as to whether the acts or omissions which form the basis of the administrative charge and proceeding arose in the course and scope of City employment. Department heads and the presiding officers of City boards or commissions shall make their request for defense to the Mayor, who shall, after receiving a report and recommendation regarding the request from the Chief of the Civil Division of the Law Department, make the determination as to whether the acts or omissions which form the basis of the administrative charge and proceeding arose in the course and scope of City employment. If the determination is made that such acts or omissions arose in the course and scope of City employment then the City shall defend the officer or employee in such administrative proceedings, including any judicial review of such proceedings. There shall be no appeal from such determinations made by the Mayor or the Chief of the Civil Division of the Law Department.

The City will not indemnify any officer or employee with respect to any monetary penalty imposed on a charge brought by the Executive Director of the Ethics and Elections Commission.

Upon receiving a request made by or on behalf of a City officer or employee that the City should pay an award of punitive damages, the Mayor shall receive a report and recommendation from the officer or employee's department head. Following receipt of the report and recommendation of the relevant department head, the Mayor shall determine whether the best interests of the City and justice will be served by payment by the City of the award for punitive damages, from which determination there shall be no appeal. The Mayor shall communicate his determination with respect to the officer or employee's request that the City pay the award of punitive damages to the officer or employee and to the City Attorney.

This chapter shall be entitled "The Affirmative Action Plan Ordinance."


### 4.80.020 - Policy.

It is the policy of the City to provide a workplace for its employees that is free from discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, political ideology, age, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap. It is also the policy of the City to take strong affirmative action to remedy the effects of past discrimination against minorities, women, handicapped and older workers, and to avoid practices which are suspect and capable of abuse or which have an adverse impact on the opportunities of such groups where it reasonably can to produce an efficient system. By doing so, the City will then be able to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities for all qualified persons and obtain a workforce in which such groups are fairly represented.


### 4.80.030 - Findings.

1. The City Council has considered the analysis of the City's present and past employment practices contained in the Appendix of the attached Affirmative Action Plan, incorporated in this chapter by reference, and other materials presented to it and previously before it relative to the need for affirmative action, and finds that affirmative action to improve the progress of such groups and remove impediments to their employment opportunities within the City continues to be necessary and proper.
2. The City Council recognizes that two (2) Washington State Superior Courts have already found certain of the City's past practices to be discriminatory against minorities and have determined not only that affirmative action within the City was necessary but was required under the circumstances evidenced as late as 1976 to eliminate the effects of such practices, and that those decisions were affirmed on appeal in Lindsay v. Seattle, 86 Wn.2d 698, 548 P.2d 320 (1976) and Maehren et al. v. Seattle, et al., 92 Wn.2d 480, 599 P.2d 1255 (1979).

### 4.80.040 - Plan adopted.

The "Affirmative Action Plan" attached to Ordinance 109112 incorporated in this chapter by reference, is adopted. City officials and employees will act in accordance with the duties and procedures set forth in the adopted plan.
