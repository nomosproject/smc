2. The Commission may require any person against whom a complaint has been filed, or any person who is reasonably believed to have information material to the determination of the charges before the Commission, to appear at a designated time and place in the City, to give such information under oath, and to produce all accounts, bills, receipts, books, papers, and documents which may be relevant or material to an investigation authorized by Chapter 2.04 or Chapter 2.06.

### Subchapter III - Campaign Disclosure
#### 2.04.150 - Intent of chapter—interpretation—construction.

1. It is the public policy of the City:

    1. That political campaign contributions and expenditures be fully disclosed to the public and that secrecy in the sources and application of such contributions be avoided;
    2. That the people have the right to expect from their elected representatives the utmost of integrity, honesty, and fairness in their dealings;
    3. That the people shall be assured that the private financial dealings of their public officials, and of candidates for those offices, present no conflict of interest between the public trust and private interest;
    4. That our representative form of government is founded on a belief that those entrusted with the offices of government have nothing to fear from full public disclosure of their financial and business holdings, provided those officials deal honestly and fairly with the people;
    5. That public confidence in municipal government is essential and must be promoted by all possible means;
    6. That public confidence in municipal government can best be sustained by assuring the people of the impartiality and honesty of the officials in all public transactions and decisions;
    7. That it is desirable to have legislation at the municipal level complementary to the concept of disclosure established in Initiative 276 (RCW Chapter 42.17A);
    8. That small contributions by individual contributors are to be encouraged, and that not requiring the reporting of small contributions may tend to encourage such contributions;
    9. That the public's right to know of the financing of political campaigns far outweighs any right that this matter remain secret and private; and
    10. That, mindful of the right of individuals to privacy and of the desirability of the efficient administration of government, full access to information concerning the conduct of municipal government must be assured as a fundamental and necessary precondition to the sound governance of a free society.
2. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to promote complete disclosure of all information respecting the financing of political campaigns so as to assure continuing public confidence of fairness of elections, and so as to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. In promoting such complete disclosure, however, this chapter shall be enforced so as to ensure that the information disclosed will not be misused by arbitrary and capricious purposes and to ensure that all persons reporting under this chapter will be protected from harassment and unfounded allegations based on information they have freely disclosed.
3. Further, it is the intent of the Council that this chapter be interpreted and applied consistent with the de minimus maxim, that inadvertent minor violations of this chapter may be corrected and cured without full hearing in a manner consistent with the spirit and intent of this chapter.

#### 2.04.155 - Electronic filing required—exemption.

1. Each candidate or political committee that expects to receive or receives $5,000 or more in aggregate contributions during the applicable period must file all reports required by this chapter with the City Clerk by electronic transmission of the required information. All political committees that (1) are neither ballot proposition nor candidate political committees, and (2) expect to make contributions or expect to make expenditures, including independent expenditures of $5,000 or more, in the aggregate during the applicable period, to or for the benefit of candidates or candidate political committees or to or for the benefit of ballot proposition political committees must file all reports required by this chapter with the City Clerk by electronic transmission. The electronic format of the filing and the method of transmission shall meet requirements designated in rules adopted by the Commission. In addition, each political committee that files electronically with the PDC must file electronically with the City Clerk.
2. The Executive Director may exempt a candidate or a committee from the requirements of this Section 2.04.155 where the candidate or the committee has shown that the requirements constitute an undue burden.

#### 2.04.156 - Electronic filing—Certification.

All reports required by this chapter that are filed electronically shall be certified as true and correct by the treasurer and candidate in accordance with procedures specified in rules adopted by the Commission. A report not so certified shall be deemed not to have been filed.

2. All audio and video broadcast political advertising, whether relating to candidates or ballot propositions, must state "paid for by" or "sponsored by," followed by the sponsor's name. All other political advertising, whether relating to candidates or ballot propositions, must state "paid for by" or "sponsored by," followed by the sponsor's name and address. The use of an assumed name is unlawful.

    1. In addition to the materials required by subsection 2.04.290.B.1, all political advertising undertaken as an independent expenditure by a person or entity, other than a bona fide political party as defined in RCW 42.17A.005(6), must include the following as part of the communication:

        1. The statement: "No candidate authorized this ad. It is paid for by (name, address, city, state)";
        2.

    3. The statements and listings of contributors required by subsections 2.04.290.B.1, B.2, and B.3 must:

        1. Appear on the first page or fold of the written communication in at least ten-point type, or in type at least ten percent of the largest size type used in a written communication directed at more than one voter, such as a billboard or poster, whichever is larger;

Facilities of public office or agency include but are not limited to use of stationery, postage, machines, and equipment, use of employees of the office or agency during working hours, vehicles, office space, publications of the office or agency, and clientele lists of persons served by the officer or agency; provided, that the foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply to the following activities:


1. Action taken at an open public meeting by the City Council to express a collective decision or to actually vote upon a motion, proposal, resolution, order or ordinance, or to support or oppose a ballot proposition so long as (1) any required notice of the meeting includes the title and number of the ballot proposition, and (2) members of the City Council or members of the public are afforded an approximate equal opportunity for the expression of an opposing view;
2. A statement by an elected official in support of or in opposition to any ballot proposition at an open press conference or in response to a specific inquiry; and
3. Activities that are part of the normal and regular conduct of the office or agency.

#### 2.04.320 - Exemption from disclosure requirements.

1. An exemption from the disclosure requirements of this chapter shall be granted by the Commission to a political association or political committee if such political association or political committee has applied in writing to the Commission for such exemption and has demonstrated by a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of contributors' names will subject the contributors to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either government officials or private parties, and that as a result of such disclosure it is reasonably probable that advocacy of a dissident view will be hindered and the right to free association chilled.
2. The decision to grant or deny an exemption from disclosure, including the basis for the decision, shall be set out in writing with a copy given to the political association or committee and a copy kept on file in the Commission's offices, for public inspection.

    1. A civil assessment of $50 for each day that the report is due but not filed for failing to make a timely filing;
    2. A civil assessment of $150 per day for any statement or report that is due within 30 days of an election for each day the statement or report is not filed up to and including election day; and
    3. A civil assessment of $50 per day that any other statement or report is due and is not filed, and for each day after election day a statement or report in subsection 2.04.330.B.2 is due and remains unfiled.
3. A filing received by mail shall be deemed filed on the date of the postmark. A filing received by facsimile or electronically shall be deemed filed when the transmission has been completely received. The Commission may adopt rules to specify how that receipt date and time is determined in each medium. It shall be a defense that a filing made solely by mail was lost in the mail.
4. The Executive Director shall determine and collect the amounts due. A person aggrieved by a determination of the Executive Director may appeal to the Commission. The decision of the Commission after a hearing shall be final.


### Subchapter IV - Campaign Contributions Limited
#### 2.04.340 - Personal use of contributions—when permitted.

Contributions received and reported under this chapter may be transferred to the personal account of a candidate, or, in the case of a ballot proposition political committee, to the personal account of a treasurer or other individual, or expended for such candidate's, treasurer's or individual's personal use only under one or more of the following circumstances:


1. As reimbursement for or loans to cover lost earnings incurred as a result of campaigning or services performed for the political committee. Such lost earnings shall be verifiable as unpaid salary, or when the individual is not salaried, as an amount not to exceed income received by the individual for services rendered during an appropriate, corresponding time period. All lost earnings incurred shall be documented and a record thereof shall be maintained by the individual or the individual's political committee. The political committee shall maintain such information in the campaign records;
2. As reimbursement for direct out-of-pocket election campaign and post-election campaign related expenses made by the individual. To receive reimbursement from the political committee, the individual shall provide the political committee with written documentation as to the amount, date, and description of each expense, and the political committee shall maintain such information in the campaign records;
3. As repayment of loans made by the individual to political committees, which repayment shall be reported pursuant to Section 2.04.250. Contributions may not be used, however, to reimburse a candidate for loans made by the candidate to the candidate's own political committee or campaign in an amount totaling more than the amount provided in RCW 42.17A.445(3) and WAC 390-05-400;
4. As payment of salary, wages and benefits or any other payment for services rendered by an individual to a campaign, but not in payment for services rendered by a candidate to that candidate's campaign.

#### 2.04.350 - Findings of fact—Limitations to be imposed.

1. The City finds that, in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, the municipal election process and municipal government should be protected from undue influence by individuals and groups making large contributions to the election campaigns of candidates for Mayor, City Council and City Attorney.
2. The City finds that, in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, the municipal election process and municipal government should be protected from even the appearance of undue influence by individuals or groups contributing to candidates for Mayor, City Council and City Attorney.
3. The City therefore finds that limitations on contributions of money, services and materials by individuals or groups to municipal election campaigns should be imposed by law to protect the public health, safety and welfare. These limitations, however, should be reasonable, so as not to discourage personal expression.

#### 2.04.360 - Application.

Sections 2.04.350 through 2.04.370 and 2.04.400 through 2.04.480 apply only to candidates in any primary, general or special election for the offices of Mayor, City Council and City Attorney of The City of Seattle.

    3. The value of in-kind labor; and

6. The limitations imposed by this section shall apply to contributions of the candidate's spouse's or state registered domestic partner's separate property.
7. The limitations in this section shall be adjusted commencing before the 2019 election cycle, and prior to each election cycle thereafter, by SEEC to account for inflation or deflation using the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, CPI-W, or a successor index, for the period since the effective date of this measure or the prior adjustment, as calculated by the United States Department of Labor. The declaration of the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries each September 30 regarding the rate by which Washington State's minimum wage rate is to be increased effective the following January 1, shall be the authoritative determination of the rate or percentage of increase or decrease to be adjusted, except that SEEC may round the new figure up or down, to the nearest $5 or $10 increment, as it deems proper.

#### 2.04.500 - Civil remedies and sanctions.

1.

    1. Upon determining that a contribution was illegally made or accepted, in addition to the remedies in subsection A1, the Commission may order the return of a contribution illegally made, and impose a penalty of two times the amount of a contribution illegally made or accepted by a person who violates Section 2.04.180, 2.04.200, 2.04.210, 2.04.215, 2.04.240, 2.04.290, 2.04.300, 2.04.370, or 2.04.480.
    2. Upon determining that a report was filed excessively late, in addition to the remedies in subsection A1, the Commission may impose a penalty of two times the amount of each deposit or expenditure for each deposit or expenditure that was reported excessively late. A report is excessively late if it was due more than 21 days before the election in which the candidate or ballot proposition appeared on the ballot, but was not filed at least 21 days before that election. A report is also excessively late if it was due within 21 days before the election in which the candidate or ballot proposition appeared on the ballot, but was not timely filed.
    3. In addition to the actions in subsections A1, A2, and A3 above, the Commission may forward the determination of violation to the Seattle City Attorney or the King County Prosecutor for prosecution. If the court finds that the violation of any provision of this chapter by any candidate or political committee probably affected the outcome of any election, the result of the election may be held void and a special election held within 60 days of such finding. Any action to void an election shall be commenced within one year of the date of the election in question. It is intended that this remedy be imposed freely in all appropriate cases to protect the right of the electorate to an informed and knowledgeable vote.
2. Whether or not there is an administrative determination as provided in subsection A, the violation or failure to comply with the provisions of Sections 2.04.160 through 2.04.290 (regarding campaign reporting), or Section 2.04.370 (regarding contribution limitations) shall constitute an infraction, not subject to the Seattle Criminal Code, for which a monetary fine, not to exceed $5,000, may be assessed by a court, however, a person or entity who violates Section 2.04.370 may be subject to a civil fine of $5,000 or be required to return the illegal contribution and pay a penalty of two times the amount of the contribution illegally made or accepted, whichever is greater. Violation of the ordinance and existence of an infraction may be proven by a preponderance of the evidence and need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. An action seeking to establish the fact of an infraction and imposition of a monetary fine under this section may be commenced by the City Attorney at a request of a majority of the Commission.
3. Any candidate who fails to comply with the requirements of Chapter 2.04 of the Seattle Municipal Code or conditions of his/her campaign contract shall be ineligible to receive further such funds until in compliance. Any candidate who exceeds the expenditure limitation for which he/she has contracted shall immediately return to the appropriate City account Three Dollars ($3) for every One Dollar ($1) he/she has overspent in that election to a maximum amount equal to the total sum of public funds he/she has received.

If the defendant prevails, he or she shall be awarded all costs of trial, and may be awarded a reasonable attorney's fee to be fixed by the court to be paid by the City.



### Subchapter VIII - Honest Elections Seattle
#### 2.04.600 - Purpose and Authority.

1. Purpose. This people's initiative measure builds honest elections in the City of Seattle ("City" or "Seattle") and prevents corruption, by: giving more people an opportunity to have their voices heard in our democracy; ensuring a fair elections process that holds our elected leaders accountable to us by strengthening voters' control over City government; banning campaign contributions by City contractors and entities using paid lobbyists; lowering campaign contribution limits; tightening prohibitions on lobbying by former elected officials (the "revolving door" problem); expanding requirements for candidates to disclose their financial holdings and interests; and increasing fines on violators of campaign rules. This measure also creates a Democracy Voucher campaign public finance program ("Democracy Voucher Program" or "Program") to expand the pool of candidates for city offices and to safeguard the people's control of the elections process in Seattle.
2. Authority of the People. The People have vested legislative powers of the City in a Mayor and City Council, but reserved to themselves independent of the Mayor and the City Council the power to propose for themselves measures dealing with any matter within the realm of local affairs or municipal business. That power includes the use of an initiative petition to submit to the qualified electors of the city a measure as authorized by RCW 84.55.050 to exceed the limitations of regular property taxes contained in RCW Chapter 84.55, as it now exists or may hereinafter be amended. The authority of the people to adopt this measure is also specifically authorized and reserved to the electors of the City of Seattle by RCW 42.17A.550, which allows a city to use locally derived public funds (whether from taxes, fees, penalties or other sources) to publicly finance local political campaigns, if the proposal to do so is submitted to City of Seattle voters for their adoption and approval, or rejection.

#### 2.04.601 - No Campaign Contributions from City Contractors or their PACs.

No Mayor, City Council member or City Attorney or any candidate for any such position shall knowingly accept any contribution directly or indirectly from any entity or person who in the prior two years has earned or received more than $250,000, under a contractual relationship with the City. No Mayor, City Council member or City Attorney or any candidate for any such position shall knowingly solicit a contribution for himself or herself or for any political party, political committee, campaign committee or public office fund, directly or indirectly from any entity or person who in the prior two years has earned or received more than $250,000, under a contractual relationship with the City. If the first sentence of this section is invalidated then no Mayor, City Council member or City Attorney or any candidate for any such position shall knowingly accept any contribution of more than $250 in one calendar year, directly or indirectly, from any entity or person who in the prior two years has earned or received more than $250,000, under a contractual relationship with the City.

In all cases such a candidate or office holder may solicit and accept assignment of Democracy Vouchers without such solicitation or assignment being considered a violation of this section.

To give campaigns time to prepare for this section, SEEC shall establish the effective date of this section by rule published reasonably in advance of the election cycle in which campaigns shall comply.

#### 2.04.620 - The Right to $100 in Democracy Vouchers, For Assignment to Qualified Candidates.

1. Democracy Vouchers. Democracy Vouchers are vital to ensure the people of Seattle have equal opportunity to participate in political campaigns and be heard by candidates, to strengthen democracy, fulfill other purposes of this subchapter and prevent corruption.
2. Issuance of Democracy Vouchers. On the first business day in every municipal election year, SEEC shall mail to each person who was by the previous November 15th, duly registered to vote in the City of Seattle, at his or her address in the voter registration records, $100 in vouchers ("Democracy Vouchers") consisting of four Democracy Vouchers of $25 each, except that SEEC may deliver Democracy Vouchers online or in other manners if the person receiving same elects other manner of delivery as provided in this subchapter. Thereafter SEEC shall regularly issue $100 in Democracy Vouchers to any person becoming a duly registered City of Seattle voter after the previous November 15th, up until October 1st of the election year. To be consistent with federal law, any adult natural person who resides more than 30 days in the City of Seattle, and who is a registered voter, or is eligible to vote under local, state or federal law, or who is eligible under federal law to donate to a political campaign, but who has not received any Democracy Vouchers in the election cycle, may opt in to the Program and obtain an equivalent number of Democracy Vouchers by application to SEEC. Any eligible adult may request Democracy Vouchers be mailed or emailed to an address other than that indicated in the voter registration records, or be delivered at SEEC offices, as soon as SEEC shall have developed a secure system for such distributions of Democracy Vouchers, including distribution online, in person, or to an address not listed in voter registration records. No resident outside Seattle, no corporation or other non-human entity, no person under the age of 18 years, and no person ineligible to make political contributions under federal law, may receive a Democracy Voucher.
3. Form of Democracy Vouchers. Each $25 Democracy Voucher shall state the holder's name, a unique voucher identification number, the election year, and words of assignment with blank spaces for the holder to designate a candidate and sign the holder's name, and may include information SEEC deems helpful for verifying signatures such as the voter identification number and barcode, in substantially the following form:
4. Assignment of Democracy Vouchers. Vouchers are only transferable or assignable as stated herein. Any person properly obtaining and holding a Democracy Voucher may assign it by writing the name of the assignee candidate, and signing the holder's name on and dating the Voucher where indicated thereon, and delivering the signed and dated Voucher to the candidate, or to SEEC, or to any candidate's representative who shall be registered for this purpose with SEEC. Delivery may be by mail, in person (by any person the holder requests to deliver the voucher), or electronically via a secure SEEC online system. SEEC shall establish a secure online system for delivery of Democracy Vouchers (without prejudice to any eligible person's right to receive Democracy Vouchers in the mail at his or her option) no later than prior to the 2017 election cycle, unless SEEC determines this target date is not practicable; and in any event no later than the 2019 election cycle.
5. Limitations on Assignment. A person may only assign a Voucher to a candidate who has chosen to participate in the Seattle Democracy Voucher Program and who has filed a signed statement of participation and pledge with SEEC as described below. No Democracy Voucher may be assigned after the last business day in November following the election, or to any candidate filing for participation who then fails to qualify or becomes unqualified for the position sought or for the Program. A candidate or registered candidate representative may seek assignment in person or through representatives or by assisting a voter to access the SEEC secure online system. A valid assignment is irrevocable. A person may assign any number of his or her Democracy Vouchers to the same candidate in a given year. Assignment or transfer for cash or any consideration is prohibited. Offering to purchase, buy or sell a Democracy Voucher is prohibited. No person may give or gift a Democracy Voucher to another person, except by assigning it to a candidate as provided herein. Democracy Vouchers have no cash value and are not assets, income or property of the holder. A Democracy Voucher may not be assigned by proxy, power of attorney or by an agent.
6. Assignor Assumes Certain Risks. A Democracy Voucher expires if the holder is no longer resident in the City of Seattle, or no longer or not eligible to make political contributions under federal law, if such circumstances take place prior to the assignment to a qualified candidate. The holder of a Democracy Voucher assumes the risk that he or she may change his or her mind after assignment, or that the Democracy Voucher may not have use or be redeemed due to any contingency, including but not limited to unavailability of Program funds; the assignee candidate reaching the "Campaign Spending Limit" (described and defined below); a candidate's death, disqualification, dropping out, failure to redeem or use the Democracy Voucher; a candidate's not qualifying or violating the terms of qualification; or otherwise.

#### 2.04.630 - Candidates to Qualify By Showing Grass Roots Support and Agreeing to New Campaign and Contribution Limits; Redemption of Democracy Vouchers; New Limits on Use of Funds.

1. Only Qualified Candidates Redeem Democracy Vouchers. Only a candidate who has filed with SEEC for participation in the Seattle Democracy Voucher Program may receive assignment of a Democracy Voucher. Only a candidate certified as qualified by SEEC may redeem a Democracy Voucher. Only a person eligible for and seeking the office of Mayor, City Attorney or City Council shall be eligible to file for Program participation.
2. Requirements for Program. To seek qualification, the candidate shall file with SEEC, on or after July 1st the year before an election year and within two weeks after filing a declaration of candidacy, a sworn statement attesting to his or her intent to participate, asserting that the candidate shall timely file or has filed a declaration of candidacy for the office indicated, and that the candidate shall comply with Program requirements and applicable campaign laws. Such Program requirements are that the candidate: shall take part in at least three public debates for primary and general elections each (as defined by SEEC, and SEEC may waive or reduce the number of debates, if a qualifying candidate makes all reasonable efforts to participate in debates and similar public events); shall comply with campaign laws and spending and contribution limits; and, the candidate shall not knowingly solicit money for or on behalf of any political action committee, political party, or any organization that will make an independent expenditure for or against any City of Seattle candidate within the same election cycle (for the purposes of this section, appearing as a featured speaker at a fundraising event for a committee or entity shall constitute soliciting money for such committee or entity). Further Program requirements are that a candidate for Mayor shall not solicit or accept total contributions from any individual or entity in excess of a total of $500 during one election cycle, and a candidate for City Attorney or City Council shall not solicit or accept total contributions from any individual or entity in excess of a total of $250 during one election cycle (including any contribution used to qualify for Democracy Vouchers, but excluding the value of Democracy Vouchers assigned to such candidate) (subject to exceptions provided herein).
3. Qualifying Contributions. To qualify for the Democracy Voucher Program, candidates shall show they have received at least the following numbers of "Qualifying Contributions" of at least $10 but not more than the Program contribution limit for the office sought provided in SMC 2.04.630(b) from individual adults (18 years of age or older), who are human natural persons residing in the City of Seattle, and eligible under federal law to make political contributions: Mayoral candidates, at least 600; City Attorney candidates, at least 150; at-large City Council candidates, at least 400; and district City Council candidates, at least 150 (of which at least 75 shall be from individuals residing in the district sought to be represented by the candidate). SEEC shall maintain a list of qualified candidates and make it readily accessible to the public, including by publishing it on SEEC's website.
4. Campaign Spending Limit. Participating candidates shall comply with all campaign laws and not exceed the following "Campaign Spending Limits" (defined as (i) money spent to date (equal to prior expenditures, plus debts and obligations), and the value of any in kind donations reported, plus (ii) cash on hand and (iii) the value of unredeemed Vouchers on hand which the candidate shall have allocated to the primary or general election): Mayor $400,000 for the primary election, and $800,000 total (for both primary and general election); City Attorney, $75,000 for the primary election, and $150,000 total; at-large City Council, $150,000 for the primary election, and $300,000 total; district City Council, $75,000 for the primary election and $150,000 total.
5. Further Limits on Redemption. A qualified candidate may collect Democracy Vouchers for the general election before the primary election takes place and allocate same to the general election without such Vouchers counting against the Campaign Spending Limit for the primary election, but may not redeem Vouchers for the general election unless such candidate advances to the general election.
6. Remedies for Exceeding Campaign Spending Limit. If a qualified candidate demonstrates to SEEC that he or she has an opponent (whether or not participating in the Program) whose campaign spending has exceeded the Campaign Spending Limit for the position sought as indicated above, where SEEC deems the excess material it shall allow such candidate to choose to be released from the Campaign Spending Limit and campaign contribution limits for the Program, in which case SEEC shall allow such candidate to redeem his or her Democracy Vouchers received theretofore or thereafter up to the amount of the Campaign Spending Limit only, then allow such candidate to engage in campaign fundraising without regard to any Program requirements. SEEC shall also release a qualifying candidate from the Campaign Spending Limit to the extent that it is shown (on application of a Seattle candidate or citizen) that said qualified candidate faces independent expenditures as defined in SMC 2.04.010 adverse to the candidate or in favor of an opponent and the sum of such independent expenditures plus said candidate's opponent's campaign spending materially exceeds the Campaign Spending Limit for that office.
7. Loss of Qualification. A candidate loses qualification for the Program by publicly announcing withdrawal, abandoning the race, failing to advance to the general election, or if SEEC finds sufficient material violations of election laws or Program requirements such as violation of spending or contribution limits, or fraudulent or attempted fraudulent assignment of Democracy Vouchers.
8. Redemption of Vouchers. SEEC shall redeem Democracy Vouchers only after verifying the assignment by ensuring the Voucher was issued to an eligible person, and verifying the signature written in the words of assignment, and only if redemption shall not put the candidate over the Campaign Spending Limit and only if Program funds are available. To verify signatures SEEC may employ the division of King County Records and Elections which verifies signatures for initiative petitions or mail-in ballots. SEEC shall redeem Democracy Vouchers on published regular redemption dates that shall be no less frequent than twice a month and may redeem Vouchers on other dates notified in advance if SEEC deems it practicable. SEEC shall not redeem any Democracy Voucher received by SEEC after the first business day in the month of December after the general election.
9. Limits on Use of Voucher Proceeds. Candidates shall use Democracy Voucher proceeds only for campaign costs or debts for the relevant office and election cycle, and may not use such proceeds after a reasonable period (to be set by SEEC) following the election to pay campaign debts. Candidates shall not use Democracy Voucher proceeds for any cash payments or in violation of any law; nor to pay the candidate (except to repay or reimburse a loan to his or her political committee or campaign in an amount not greater than that provided in RCW 42.17A.445(3) or WAC 390-05-400) or pay a member of the candidate's immediate family as defined in RCW 4.16.030; pay any entity in which the candidate or an immediate family member holds a ten percent or greater ownership interest; pay any amount over fair market value for any services, goods, facilities or things of value; pay any penalty or fine; or pay any inaugural costs or office funds cost.
10. Return of Democracy Voucher Proceeds. A candidate who has redeemed a Democracy Voucher, then withdraws, dies, becomes ineligible, loses qualification, or is eliminated in any primary or general election or wins a general election, shall within a reasonable period, as defined by SEEC, pay all debts and obligations, account to SEEC and restore to SEEC and the Program "Unspent Democracy Voucher Proceeds." SEEC shall define "Unspent Democracy Voucher Proceeds" by rule.

#### 2.04.658 - Transparency.

Assigning a Democracy Voucher is a public act and recipients of Democracy Vouchers shall expect same to be public and made public and shall have no expectation of privacy in registering to obtain Democracy Vouchers or in assigning same. All Democracy Voucher holders are on notice the process is public and transparent, except that SEEC shall not publish mail, email or other addresses to which Democracy Vouchers are sent. SEEC shall make transparent at its offices and on its website all assignments and redemptions of Democracy Vouchers including recipient name, Democracy Voucher identification number and suffix, date assigned, to whom assigned, when redeemed and amount redeemed. SEEC shall provide other necessary means to make the Seattle Democracy Voucher process and Program open and transparent so that each Democracy Voucher recipient and the media and public may track assignments of Democracy Vouchers to assist in exposing any potential forgery, fraud, or misconduct regarding same. If a Democracy Voucher recipient believes that his or her Democracy Voucher was lost, stolen or fraudulently or improperly assigned or redeemed, SEEC shall require a notarized declaration or affidavit or additional process in its judgment to find the relevant facts then provide relief it deems appropriate including Democracy Voucher replacement, cancellation of assignment or reimbursement of any improperly obtained Program funds. SEEC shall promulgate rules and regulations for such proceedings and cases where it receives duplicate copies of the same Democracy Voucher and shall ensure that any Democracy Voucher recipient may attempt to show, without any filing fee or charge, the facts of loss, theft, destruction or forgery of or duress in or other improper acts concerning or in the assignment of the Democracy Voucher. Such process shall include procedures through mails or in person and shall include an online process when and if SEEC develops same. SEEC shall also provide forms, and for in-person procedures, a notary at SEEC offices during normal business hours for this purpose, without charge. In all cases, no Democracy Voucher assignment shall be deemed invalid or revocable simply because the assignor changes opinion or changes his or her mind, gets new information from or about any candidate or campaign, or based on any allegation of misstatement or misinformation by any candidate or any person, or any other source, or for any reason other than duplicate voucher or forgery, threats, coercion, or physical duress, shown by clear and convincing evidence. SEEC shall issue regulations providing remedies and consequences for such acts, which may include, for sufficient material violation of Program requirements, campaign laws, or any acts of intentional forgery, threats, duress, or coercion in obtaining assigned Democracy Vouchers, an order requiring a candidate to return to the Program any proceeds of Democracy Vouchers or disqualifying a candidate from the Program.


#### 2.04.690 - Transition; SEEC Administration Authority; Penalties; Crimes; Severability.

1. Transition. To allow accumulation of Program funds, in the 2017 election only and notwithstanding other provisions of this subchapter, no Mayoral candidate shall be eligible to participate in the Program or receive or redeem Democracy Vouchers.
2. SEEC to administer. SEEC shall implement and administer the Program, Program funds, and provisions in this subchapter including issuing and promulgating appropriate regulations, forms, rules, information packets, procedures, and enforcement mechanisms. SEEC shall through rule making carry out the provisions of this subchapter including but not limited to making regulations, defining terms, establishing other rules or promulgating any other administrative regulations or guidelines not inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter. Anything herein said to be done by SEEC, other than such rule making, shall be done by its Executive Director or another person indicated in SEEC regulations or a duly approved printer or contractor. Prior to each election cycle, SEEC shall inform the public about Democracy Vouchers and the Program. SEEC shall publish appropriate guidebooks for candidates and Democracy Voucher recipients, and all forms, instructions, brochures and documents necessary and proper for this Program, which shall include key documents accessible to those with visual or other disability, and translations into languages other than English spoken by a significant number of Seattle residents, which shall be presumed initially to include Spanish, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Mandarin, Somali, Tagalog, Korean, Cambodian, Amharic, Oromo, Tigrinya, Laotian, Thai, and Russian. Prior to each election cycle, SEEC may reasonably adjust the Campaign Spending Limits, the dollar amounts for and numbers of qualifying contributions, the contribution limits per contributor provided in SMC 2.04.630(b) (but SEEC shall not set a contribution limit for qualifying candidates that exceeds the contribution limit specified for candidates in SMC 2.04.370, or the number or value of Democracy Vouchers provided to each eligible person, in order to account for inflation or deflation, and ensure the goals and purposes of the Program including democracy and accountability, high rates of candidate participation, heavy utilization of vouchers by those who have not previously donated to Seattle political campaigns, and high public satisfaction with the Program. After each election cycle SEEC shall review the Program and submit reports to the public and City Council. Promptly after the effective date of this measure, SEEC shall project Program revenue, expenditures, and Democracy Voucher Program Funds ("Program Funds") balances from 2016 through at least 2021, and shall revise and update such projections regularly, and at all times shall manage Program Funds as a fiduciary, ensuring proper accumulation and distribution of funds, during nonelection and election years, to achieve Program purposes and goals. In making such projections and administering this Program, SEEC shall consider all relevant circumstances including differing Campaign Spending Limits for different offices, differing funding needs in mayoral and non-mayoral election years, and the need to manage the Program and funds to seek to ensure participation by candidates. SEEC before January 1st of each municipal election year shall manage and prudently conserve Program Funds, by considering and projecting Program Funds availability and disbursements for that year and publicizing such projections which shall include and consider needs of participating candidates, needs for conservation of funds for future years or reserve accumulation, prudent operating cost and cost of administration, and prudent conservation of public resources. To assure candidates that ample funds will be available for Voucher redemptions and to assure the public that Voucher fund redemptions will be prudently managed, by January 1st of each municipal election year, SEEC shall publish an "Available Program Funds Limit" for that year for Voucher redemptions. In setting the Available Program Funds Limit, SEEC shall use its best efforts to reasonably project and ensure that adequate Program Funds are available for that election year consistent with this subchapter, its goals and purposes and all reasonably foreseeable circumstances and contingencies and shall set aside at least an amount needed for six primary and two general election candidates for each position in that year's election to qualify and spend their respective Campaign Spending Limit using Democracy Vouchers only (rather than private contributions, except for private contributions used to qualify). During any municipal election year, as soon as SEEC receives or reasonably believes it shall receive Democracy Vouchers for redemption in excess of the Available Program Funds Limit for that year, then Program Funds shall be deemed unavailable and SEEC shall publicly announce same and set a prompt deadline date for Democracy Voucher delivery, following which SEEC shall consider Democracy Vouchers received and available Program Funds and shall allocate remaining available Program Funds proportionately per unredeemed verified Democracy Vouchers on hand, pro rata among all participating candidates for all offices without discrimination. If any special election is called, SEEC shall set aside Program Funds for such election in an amount it deems appropriate, and shall be empowered to act and change, alter, or modify or set and implement standards, procedures, limits and deadlines as similar as may be practicable to those provided in this subchapter as SEEC deems proper and necessary for such special election, taking care to not unduly prejudice accumulation of funds for the Program.
3. Penalties. No penalty provision in this subchapter shall diminish any other penalty or remedy under any other law. Participating candidates who make expenditures in excess of the Campaign Spending Limit shall be subject to a civil penalty of twice the amount of the expenditure in excess of such limit, unless SEEC determines that the overspending is insignificant or trivial. All enforcement, administrative and other powers, procedures, rights, duties, remedies, process, civil penalties and other provisions in SMC 2.04.060, 2.04.070, 2.04.075, 2.04.090, 2.04.500, 2.04.510, 2.04.520, 2.16.010 and 2.16.020, relating to violations of election campaign contributions laws or initiative laws, shall apply in case of violations of this subchapter, and all penalties, remedies or consequences applicable to violations of SMC 2.04 or 2.06 shall be applicable for any violation of this subchapter, including but not limited to an order requiring the party to take particular action in order to comply with the law, and in addition, or alternatively, sanctions up to $5,000 for each violation.
4. Crimes. A person is guilty of trafficking in a Democracy Voucher if the person knowingly purchases, buys, or pays consideration for any Democracy Voucher or knowingly sells, conveys for consideration or receives consideration for any Democracy Voucher; or attempts same. A person is guilty of theft of a Democracy Voucher if he or she steals (defined as when one knowingly obtains or exerts unauthorized control over with intent to deprive the proper holder or recipient thereof) or attempts to steal, a Democracy Voucher. A person is guilty of the crime of forgery of a Democracy Voucher if, with intent to injure or defraud, he or she attempts to falsely make, complete, or alter a Democracy Voucher or its assignment or possess, utter, offer, dispose of, or put off as true a Democracy Voucher or written assigned Democracy Voucher that he or she knows is forged. For purposes of this section, "falsely alter" means to change, without authorization by the holder or recipient of the Voucher entitled to grant it, a Democracy Voucher by means of erasure, obliteration, deletion, insertion of new matter, transposition of matter, or in any other manner; to "falsely complete" means to make a Democracy Voucher assignment complete by adding or inserting matter, including but not limited to a forged signature, without the authority of the person entitled to assign the Voucher; to "falsely make" means to make or draw a complete or incomplete Democracy Voucher which purports to be authentic, but which is not authentic either because the ostensible maker is fictitious or because, if real, he or she did not authorize the making or drawing or signing thereof; and "forged" or "forgery" means a Democracy Voucher which has been falsely made, completed, or altered. A person is guilty of possession of a stolen Democracy Voucher if he, she or it, being other than the recipient of a proper assignment of a Democracy Voucher, knowingly receives, retains, possesses, conceals or disposes of another's Democracy Voucher knowing that it has been stolen and withholds or appropriates the same to the use of any person other than the true owner or person entitled thereto. A person is guilty of trafficking in a stolen Democracy Voucher if the person attempts to traffic in a stolen Democracy Voucher, meaning to sell, transfer, distribute, dispense, or otherwise dispose of such stolen Democracy Voucher pertaining to another person, or to buy, receive, possess, or obtain control of same with intent to sell, transfer, distribute, dispense, or otherwise dispose of the property to another person. The crimes of trafficking in a Democracy Voucher, theft or forgery of a Democracy Voucher, possession of a stolen Democracy Voucher, or trafficking in a stolen Democracy Voucher, are each a gross misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $5,000 or, by imprisonment for a term of up to 364 days, or both, or as otherwise provided by State law. In this subsection the term "person," "he," "she" or "actor" include any natural person, and, in addition, a corporation, a joint stock association, an unincorporated association or a political committee. In cases of all crimes defined by this subsection the Court may also require restitution to the Program of all costs of prosecution, including attorneys fees, as well as any amounts misappropriated or the face value of Democracy Vouchers misused and in case of crimes by a candidate or political committee the Court also may require return of all funds received from the Program in that election cycle consistent with equity, due process and proportional justice and or may disqualify such political committee or candidate from participating in the Program for that election cycle.
5. Severability and captions. Provisions of this subchapter and its sections are separate and severable. The invalidity of any part or its application to any circumstance, shall not affect the validity of other parts or application to other circumstances. Captions provided are not substantive. The City Clerk may renumber or reformat this subchapter, this ordinance or these sections, for proper codification in the Seattle Municipal Code, without changing the substance.
